New features with AN-2008-08-21:

-	Mkisofs now correctly sets the permissions for "invented" unreal
	directories in UDF instread of using mode 000. The last version
	intruced a bug during the code clean phase.

-	SCCS fixed a problem with 64 bit compatibility.

-	The Program sccs(1) now implements a -R option.

	Most subcommands now support the -R option (before the subcommand).

	sccs -R tell		Lists all currently edited files
	sccs -R get		Get's everytrhing from SCCS/s. files
	sccs -R diffs		shows the diffs for all edited files
	sccs -R diffs ` sccs -R tell -U ` shows the diffs for all files edited by you
	sccs -R delget		performs a "delta" and a "get" on all files
				currently edited
	sccs -R unedit		removed _all_ edited files be careful!

	There are more sub-commands that support -R

	For sub-commands that (currently) do not support recursion, the
	following message is printed:

	sccs -R admin
	sccs: Recursion not supported for "admin"

	*** Please test and report!

-	SCCS get and SCCS delta implement a (hidden) option -Cdir to
	support recursive operation with sccs(1).
