.SH NAME
termcap \- a termcap compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
termcap
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B termcap
reads termcap entries and outputs them in unified order and
with unified escape sequences. This allows one to convert termcap
files into a comparable format.
.PP
Since the termcap database is an ASCII representation of the data,
people may believe that there is no need for a compiler.
Syntax checks and unification however are a property of compilers.
The
.B termcap
program checks for correct data types, outputs all entries in a unified
order and recodes all strings with the same escape notation.
This is needed in to compare two entries and it makes life easier.
.PP
When
.B termcap
compiles entries, it checks the entries for noncompliance. If any problems
were found, it inserts comments in the form:
.sp
.BI "# NOTICE(" name ")" " some reason"
.sp
or
.sp
.BI "# BAD(" name ")" " some reason"
.sp
before the related termcap entry.
These comments should be carefully checked.
Frequent problems are illegally escaped colons \e: instead of \e072 that in 
most cases have been created by defective
.B terminfo
software.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-help
Prints a short summary of the
.BR termcap (1)
options and exists.
.TP
.B \-version
Prints the
.BR termcap (1)
version number string and exists.
.TP
.B \-dooctal
When printing terminal capabilities, prefer octal output like
.B \e003
before escape sequences like
.BR ^C .
.TP
.B \-dumplist
Dump the complete internal list of terminal capabilities.
.br
.ne 5
.TP
.B \-e
Import the termcap description from the
.B TERMCAP
environment if present.
By default,
.BR termcap (1)
ignores the
.B TERMCAP
environment in case that it does not hold a pathname, but a preparsed 
termcap entry.
.br
.ne 5
.TP
.BI if= filename
Read the file 
.I filename
with many termcap entries and produce compiled output in standard order
on 
.BR stdout .
This option is used in order to recompile a whole set of termcap entries.
.sp
To make the recompiling as smooth as possible,
.B \-inorder
is assumed by default. Use
.B \-noinorder
if you like to add further processing by hand.
.TP
.B \-inorder
Output all capabilities in the standard order. First the boolean
capabilities, then the numeric capabilities and at last the string
capabilities. Without
.BR \-inorder ,
the obsolete capabilities are printed last.
.sp
The option
.B \-inorder
is assumed by default if the
.BI if= name
option has been specified.
.TP
.B \-gnugoto
Allow the GNU tgoto() format extensions %C and %m.
.TP
.B \-nodisabled
Do not output disabled termcap entries. A comment with a warning for this
entry is still printed in the output.
.TP
.B \-noinorder
Output all capabilities in the standard order, but print
obsoleted capabilities, unknown capabilities and disabled capabilities
in a separate block before any
.B tc=
entry.
.TP
.B \-nounknown
Do not output unknown termcap entries. A comment with a warning for this
entry is still printed in the output.
.TP
.B \-nowarn
Do not warn about incorrect entries that could be fixed by assuming that the
problem is a result from not correctly converting escape sequences in
.B terminfo 
syntax to termcap syntax. For this purpose, currently null characters
.RB ( \e0 )
are converted to 
.BR \e200 .
In addition, the escape sequences
.BR \ea ,
.BR \ee ,
.BR \e: ,
.BR \e, ,
.B \es
and
.B \el
are mapped to BEL, ESCAPE, ':', ',', ' ' and LINEFEED.
.TP
.B \-oneline
Output all termcap entries in a single line per entry.
This helps to scan the whole termcap data base for terminals with specific
properties.
.TP
.B \-s
Output commands to set and export
.B TERM
and
.BR TERMCAP .
This can be done with
.sp
.B "  eval `tset -s ...`"
.sp
to bring the terminal information into the environment of shells that
do not support
.B termcap 
internally as e.g.
.B sh
(recent Bourne Shell versions) and
.B bsh
already do.
Doing so makes 
.B termcap 
based programs start up faster.
If the
.B SHELL
environment variable ends with
.BR csh ,
C shell commands are created, otherwise Bourne
shell commands are created.
.TP
.B \-tc
Follow
.B tc=
entries and generate cumulative output.
Amongst others, this allows one to retrieve the cumulative size of the related
termcap entry.
.B Termcap
normally does not interpret
.B tc=
entries in order to allow the entries to be reused the same way they are
in the termcap file.
.sp
When the
.B \-tc
option is used together with
.BI if= filename
and 
.BR termcap (1)
is in compile mode, the output will increase noticeably in size as all
.B termcap
entries for all terminals will be fully expanded. This also removes all
hints to similar terminals in the output.
.TP
.B \-v
Increment verbose level.
By default, 
.B termcap
only prints a recoded termcap entry. With increasing verbose level, more 
information on the termcap entry is printed.
With a higher verbose level,
.B termcap
prints the size of the termcap entry.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B HOME
To find the private files like
.B ~/.termcap
.TP
.B TERM
The type of terminal for which the output should be formatted.
.TP
.B TERMCAP
This environment variable holds either a precompiled termcap entry
or the pathname to be used to find a termcap database file.
If it holds a precompiled entry that does not match the
.B TERM
environment, the termcap database is parsed as if the
.B TERMCAP 
environment is not set.
.TP
.B TERMPATH
If 
.B TERMCAP
is empty, then the
.B TERMPATH
environment is scanned for pathnames of files that contain a
.B termcap
database.
It holds a list of filenames separated by colons or spaces (i.e.,  ":" or " ").
If the TERMPATH symbol is not set, the files
.I $HOME/.termcap
and
.I /etc/termcap
are scanned in that order.

.SH FILES
.TP
.B /etc/termcap
The system's terminal capabilities database.
.TP
.B ~/.termcap
The private terminal capabilities database.
This file is checked first, in case that the
.B TERMPATH
environment is not defined.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR sh (1),
.BR bsh (1),
.BR tset (1B),
.BR termcap (5).

.SH MESSAGES
.PP
The following messages are created by
.BR termcap (1):
.TP
.B "# BAD(name). Skipping blank entry: 'ent'"
A colon (":") is followed by white space. White space is only permitted in
a
.B termcap
entry if it appears at the beginning of a line.
.sp
This error type is usually caused by a bad manual edit.
Carefully check every such problem in the source and manually correct it.
.TP
.B "# BAD(name). Illegal entry (3rd char 'c' for ':ccc'): 'ent'"
A valid
.B termcap
entry is made of two characters followed by a colon (":")
in case of a boolean entry, a hash mark ("#") in case of an integer entry,
an equal sign ("=") for a string entry,
or the at sign ("@") for disabled entries.
.sp
This error type is usually caused by a bad conversion from a
.B terminfo 
entry
that is caused by illegal quoting. A bad quoting may cause the
.B termcap
parser to be out of sync. A quoted colon ("\e:") is permitted in 
.B terminfo
but not in
.B termcap
.RB ( termcap
only permits "\e072" to include a colon in a string).
.sp
This error may also be caused by a bad manual edit, e.g. a backslash
("\e") at the end of a termcap entry that causes the next terminal name to
be interpreted as capability, a colon (":") instead of a bar ("|") in the 
list of alternative terminal names or superfluous colon (":") in the list
of capabilities.
.sp
Carefully check every such problem in the source and manually correct it.
.TP
.B "# BAD(name). Type mismatch 'ent' in 'full\-ent' ..."
The type for the current entry does not match the type from the termcap
documentation.
.sp
This error type is usually caused by a bad manual edit, e.g. from typing
":", "=" or "#" instead of the correct character "=" or "#" that is expected
as the third character for the entry.
Carefully check every such problem in the source and manually correct it.
.TP
.B "# BAD(name). Bad format '%c' in 'ent=value'"
An invalid format character was found in a parameterized string (a string
that is passed to
.BR tgoto() ).
.sp
This error type is usually caused by badly converted 
.B terminfo
entry.
Carefully check every such problem in the source and manually correct it.
.TP
.B "# BAD(name). Buffer overflow in 'ent=value'"
A string that is passed to
.B tgoto()
is longer than 80 characters.
.B tgoto()
is not granted to work correctly in case that the parameterized string is
longer than 80 characters.
.sp
This error type is usually caused by badly converted 
.B terminfo
entry.
Carefully check every such problem in the source and manually correct it.

.TP
.B "# NOTICE(name). Short entry (':c:') removed"
All
.B termcap
capability names must have two characters. A single char entry was found and removed.
.TP
.B "# NOTICE(name). Disabled entry: '.ent'"
An entry that starts with a dot (".") was found.
.sp
This is usually caused by an intentional manual edit.
.TP
.B "# NOTICE(name). Unknown entry ('ent'): 'full\-ent'"
An entry was found that is not part of the official
.B termcap
documentation.
.sp
It is unlikely that such an entry is supported by any program, so these
entries may be removed from the the
.B termcap
database.
This may be done automatically by specifying the
.B \-nounknown
option.
.TP
.B "# NOTICE(name). Canceled entry 'ent@' followed by 'full\-ent'..."
A cancelled entry in the form "xx@" was followed by "xx=string" or
"xx#number" in the same termcap entry.
The
.B cancel
feature in
.B termcap
entries is intended to cancel entries from capabilities imported via the
.BI tc= name
feature. 
.sp
Carefully check every such problem in the source whether it was introduced
intentionally (e.g. in order to temporarily disable a feature) or whether
it was introduced by accident.
.TP
.B "# NOTICE(name). NULL char (fixed) in entry ('ent') at..."
A "\e0" string was found in a
.B termcap
entry.
This is not permitted by the
.B termcap
documentation.
.sp
This error type is usually caused by a bad conversion from a
.B terminfo
entry.
This typically happens if bad software converted a "\eE" string to "\e" or 
in case that the string "\e0" that is valid in a
.B terminfo
entry was not converted to the correct
.B termcap
equivalent: "\e200".
.BR termcap (1)
assumes the latter and automatically converts "\e0" to "\e200".
A NULL character may be used as a delay in an output sequence, but it is not expected in
function key input sequence.
Carefully check every such problem in the source and manually correct it.
.TP
.B "# NOTICE(name). Nonoctal char 'c' in entry ('ent') at position..."
A character outside the range '0'..'7' was found in a '\ennn' octal sequence.
.sp
Carefully check every such problem in the source and manually correct it.
.TP
.B "# NOTICE(name). Badly quoted char '\ec' (fixed) in ('ent') at ..."
A character quoted with "\e" was found but the character is not in the list
of quotes documented by
.BR termcap .
As the character was from the list "\ea", "\ee", "\e:", "\e,", "\es", "\el"
it is assumed that the problem was caused by a bad conversion from a
.B terminfo
entry.
.sp
Carefully check every such problem in the source and manually correct it if needed.
.TP
.B "# NOTICE(name). Badly quoted char '\ec' in ('ent') at ..."
A character quoted with "\e" was found but the character is not in the list
of quotes documented by
.BR termcap .
As the character was neither from the list "\ea", "\ee", "\e:", "\e,", "\es", "\el"
it is assumed that the problem was caused by a bad manual edit.
.sp
Carefully check every such problem in the source and manually correct it.

.SH NOTES
.PP
Termcap databases that have been created from a terminfo database often are full
of noncompliances that prevent successful parsing by termcap-compliant software.
The fact that terminfo permits "\e:" is the cause for the majority of all problems
but fortunately can be automatically resolved.
.PP
There is a non-compliance between older and newer
.B termcap
entries. The capability named "ma" in former times (around 1980) was an 
arrow key map for the
.BR rogue (1)
.I "Dungeons of Doom"
game.
In newer times, the "ma" entry is used for the maximum number of attributes a
terminal can handle and thus is of type integer.
.PP
As the functions
.BR tgetstr ()
and
.BR tgetnum ()
both skip entries with inappropriate type, this is not a problem.
For this reason, we do not warn of a possible string/number type conflict 
with the "ma" capability. It is even possible to have a
.BI ma= maplist
and
.BI ma# num-attr
entry at the same time for the same terminal entry.
