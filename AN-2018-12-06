New features with AN-2018-12-06:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. If your smake is too old and aborts, ensure this
	*** by calling:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4
	The recent smake version is smake-1.3

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-01-26 introduced
	*** optimizations for the Schily version of SunPro Make, you
	*** need at least the dmake version from 2018/01/11 with support
	*** for the "export" directive to compile with this makefile system.


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

-	COPYING: updated the copyright date bor bsh.

-	libfind: With the changes from 2018-11-22, the code did not compile
		anymore on platforms without vfork(). This problem has been
		fixed.

-	patch: The patch unit test suite now allows to disable the random delta
		tests that take a long time but verify whether patch is able
		to deal with arbitrary changes in the files. To disable the
		random tests call:

			cd patch/tests
			NO_RANDOM=TRUE smake tests

-	smt: smt -wready now checks whether the last open really failed before
		retrying the open operation.

		Thanks to Pavel Raiskup for reporting this coverity result.

-	star: hole.c: A memory leak in in hole.c::put_sparse() has been fixed.

		Thanks to Pavel Raiskup for reporting this coverity result.

-	star: xheader.c: the macro scopy() no longer has a semicolon at the end.

		Thanks to Pavel Raiskup for reporting this coverity result.

-	SCCS:	libcomobj: A parser for the SCCS v6 flags has been added.
		Since there are currently no SCCS v6 flags, this parser prints
		a warning for all SCCS v6 flags and thus will warn, when 
		it sees SCCS history files created from newer SCCS versions. 

-	SCCS:	libcomobj: A parser for SCCS v6 global meta data has been
		added. It currently supports the inital path name and
		the unified random number that is given to files to make them
		unique.

-	SCCS:	libcomobj: a new function sfree() frees the line buffer that
		is used by getdelim()

-	SCCS: all programs that call the SCCS v4 flag parser now also call
		the SCCS v6 flag parser and the parser for SCCS v6 meta data.

-	SCCS: prs: now prints the SCCS v6 initial path using the new keyword
		:Gp:

-	SCCS: prs: now prints the SCCS v6 unified random using the new keyword
		:Gr:

-	SCCS: The sccs unit test suite now allows to disable the random delta
		tests that take a long time but verify whether sccs is able
		to deal with arbitrary changes in the files. To disable the
		random tests call:

			cd sccs/tests
			NO_RANDOM=TRUE smake tests

-	SCCS: admin no longer has a file descriptor leak when is is used 
		to modify more than one SCCS history file (e.g. by modifying
		flag values).

-	SCCS: All low level programs no call sfree() and thus avoid a memory
		leak from the line buffer when they are used with more than 
		one file.

-	SCCS: admin now supports two new options:

	-	-XGp	The initial SCCS v6 path
			If specified as "-XGp=", no initial path is written
			to the history file.

	-	-XGr	The SCCS v6 unified random
			If specified as "-XGr=", no unified random is written
			to the history file.

	Both options are oly honored when a new history file is created.

	If one of these options is used, admin only supports one file type
	argument. 

-	SCCS: comb now supports to retain SCCS v6 initial path and SCCSv6 urand
		to be retained in the new reduced history file.

-	SCCS man pages: more hints on SCHILY specific options have been added.

-	SCCS: val: the check for a back-going clock now also checks nanoseconds
	from SCCS v6 history files.

-	SCCS: libcomobj: the check for a back-going clock in dodelt() now also 
	checks nanoseconds from SCCS v6 history files.

-	SCCS: libcomobj: the bulk mode path handler bulkprepare() now permits
	files that do not (yet) exist. This is needed for several reasons for
	e.g. the new admin features and to permit get(1) to be able to extract
	a g-file that has not yet been checked out.

-	SCCS: admin: when the bulk option -N has been introduced in Summer 2011,
	this has been done mainly to be able to verify whether SCCS is still
	faster than other version control software. It was used to allow to test
	the performance for importing large amounts of files into SCCS and thus
	-N implied -n and -i and the SCCS history files have always been
	intialized from the related g-files.

	Now the -N option no longer implies -n or -i. If a new history file
	should be created, "admin -N... -n ..." needs to be used and if the
	history files should be initialized from the g-files, the command
	"admin -N... -i. ..." needs to be used. The option -i followed by a dot
	now tells admin to use the computed related g-file name to initialize
	history files on bulk mode.

	With this change, admin now allows to e.g. use the -N option to set
	flags in a larger list of files by e.g. calling "admin -NSCCS -fx *.c".

-	SCCS: sccscvt: When converting from SCCS v4 to SCCS v6, the initial path
	and the unified random are now added if not yet present.

-	SCCS: scat: the program now identifies itself as "sact" instead of "unget"
	which was a result of being a single program with hard links.

-	SCCS unit tests: New tests for checking the SCHILY SCCS specific new
	val(1) options -v and -T have been added.

-	SCCS unit tests: A new test checks whether delta -Xprepend works correctly

-	SCCS: defines.h: New flags for the Nparms allow to tell the function
	bulkprepate() from libcomobj to know whether a file or directory
	needs to exist.

-	SCCS: libcomobj::bulkprepare() The space for Nparms.n_prefix is no
	longer allocated via fmalloc() but with malloc(), since the content
	of Nparms must survice a call to ffreeall() that is called after working
	on one file from the file list.

-	SCCS: libcomobj::bulkprepare() in case that a new s.file should be
	created, the directory for the s.file is auto created in case that it
	is missing.

-	SCCS: libcomobj::bulkprepare() in case that the N_GETI flag is set,
	the directory for the g-file is auto created in case that it is
	missing.

-	SCCS: libcomobj::bulkprepare() use resolvenpath() instead of 
	resolvepath() in case that the base directory of a file does not
	need to exist.

-	SCCS: libcomobj::bulkprepare() The program is aborted again in case
	that the base directory of a file needs to exist but is missing.

-	SCCS: libcomobj::bulkprepare() The libschily implementation for
	resolvepath() does not allow to use the same space for the input
	path and the output path name. We now copy the input path to a
	temporary variable to allow it to work on platforms other that
	Solaris.

-	SCCS: libcomobj::bulkprepare() We now use fallback code in case that
	the base directory of the s.file does not yet exist and chdir()
	thus does not work.

-	SCCS: libcomobj::bulkprepare() The struct member N->n_dir_name is now
	set to NULL in case that we did not do a chdir().

-	SCCS: libcomobj  New function freeN() allows to free Nparms.n_prefix

-	SCCS: libcomobj  New function Ndbg() allows to to debug bulkprepare(),
	e.g. the result from parseN().

-	SCCS: libcomobj::set_init_path() fixed a bug that could cause a core
	dump in SCCS v6 mode, when the dir parameter is a NULL pointer.

-	SCCS: libmpw::sname() no longer addresses out of bound data from the
	string parameter (s[-1]).

-	SCCS: admin now marks the Nparms structure to indicate that in case of
	"admin -N -n file", the s-file does not need to exist when running
	bulkprepare().

-	SCCS: admin now marks the Nparms structure to indicate that in case of
	"admin -N+ -n file", the directory to place the g-file does not need to exist
	while running bulkprepare().

-	SCCS: get now marks the Nparms structure to indicate that in case of
	"get -N file", the directory to place the g-file does not need to exist
	while running bulkprepare().

-	SCCS: comb no longer prints the PATH= line repeated in case that
	more than one file type argument was used.

-	SCCS: comb now prints a "cd" command in the script in cace that
	comb(1) did chdir() while calling bulkprepare() for the -N bulk mode.

-	SCCS: all commands: setsig() and xsethome(NULL) are now called before
	calling parseN(). This helps to prevent core dumps from bad code in
	parseN() and this allows parseN() to know whether a command runs in
	"project off tree" mode.

-	SCCS: admin & delta: the function parseX() has been moved to 
	libcomobj.

-	SCCS: admin & sccscvt: the Initial Path is now only created in case
	that the -N option was used as otherwise, the program cannot know
	the real g-file name. This is because up to now, the handling of the
	"SCCS/" subdirectory is handled in the program sccs(1) and not
	understood by the low end programs.

-	SCCS: libcomobj::putmeta() now first prints the unified random and then
	the initial path. This helps to keep the order even when the initial
	path is added later.

-	SCCS: libcomobj::set_init_path() now expects a g-file name instead of
	an s.file name. This helps to have correct initial path names in the
	history file.

-	SCCS: libmpw: added a new xmalloc() that checks for NULL and aborts.

-	SCCS: man pages: the man pages now explain that with "-N" and "-Ns",
	the s.files are in the same directory as the g-files.

-	SCCS unit tests: A new test for even longer lines now checks whether
	sccs works with lines of 100000 bytes length.

-	SCCS unit tests: New tests check whether admin(1) correctly deals with
	all kind of -N parameters and more than file type argument.

-	SCCS unit tests: New tests check whether delta(1) correctly deals with
	all kind of -N parameters and more than file type argument.

-	SCCS unit tests: New tests check whether get(1) correctly deals with
	all kind of -N parameters and more than file type argument.

-	SCCS unit tests: New tests check whether sccscvt(1) correctly deals with
	all kind of -N parameters and more than file type argument.

-	SCCS unit tests: New tests check whether cdc(1), prs(1), prt(1),
	rmdel(1), sact(1), sccslog(1), unget(1), val(1)
	deal with all kind of -N parameters and more than file type argument.
	These tests are simpler than the tests for admin(1) and get(1).

-	SCCS unit tests: A set of unit tests for sccscvt(1) have been added.

-	SCCS unit tests: A set of unit tests for comb(1) have been added.

-	SCCS unit tests: A set of unit tests for sccscvt(1) have been added
	to check whether sccscvt adds the initial path while converting.

-	SCCS is now in a state that is close before being ready with project
	support. This means that SCCS soon will be able to deal with lists
	of files as a whole and have a global locking for operations on file
	lists.

	The current state is that SCCS most likely is ready with all infra
	structure enhancements for project support except for the code to
	deal with the changeset file and the name cache.

-	SCCS: The version has been bumped to 5.09 with date 2018/12/05.

-	SCCS TODO:

	-	Convert sccs.c to use -NSCCS in the back end programs instead
		of converting g-file names from the command line into s.file
		names in the frontend in order to forward s.file names to the
		backend programs. Doing it this way allows us to have the SCCS
		history files "off tree" in a separate directory tree starting
		with ".sccs/" at the "project root" directory, as the related
		code to convert path names is in libcomobj::bulkprepare().

	-	Add code to admin(1) and delta(1) to retrieve the list of
		new or modified files in order to have all important code
		for a "sccs commit" in a single program that does not need to
		deal with ARG_MAX limitations.

	-	Add code to admin(1), delta(1) and get(1) to maintain/understand
		the changeset file.

	-	Add code to libcomobj to understand the changeset file,
		which is needed in order to e.g. know the file names and file
		specific SIDs/state that correspond to a project global SID.

	-	Add code to all programs to maintain a lock (for the file
		$PROJECTHOME/.sccs/SCCS/s.changeset, that would be in the file
		$PROJECTHOME/.sccs/SCCS/z.changeset) to maintain a project
		global lock.

	-	Find/verify a complete transactional model that allows to repair
		complex changes to the set of files for a project that have
		been aborted in the middle. The current idea is to create the
		file $PROJECTHOME/.sccs/changeset with the deltas to the
		changeset during a complex update operation.

	-	Find a way to decide when to use SCCS v6 type history files.
		For the project mode, this is needed in order to prevent 
		historic SCCS implementations to believe they could modify
		files without knowing about project global locks.





-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.

-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
