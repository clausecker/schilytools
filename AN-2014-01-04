New features with AN-2014-01-04:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	Define DEV_NULL in include/schily/mconfig.h to address the missing
	/dev/null on DOS

-	New autoconf tests for:
	getc_unlocked getchar_unlocked putc_unlocked putchar_unlocked
	flockfile funlockfile ftrylockfile

-	Symlinks for 
	armv4tl-linux-cc.rul s390x-linux-cc.rul armv5tel-linux-cc.rul
	new, to support non-automake aware make programs such as gmake.

-	Do not define a gethostname() prototype in schily/hostname.h
	for MinGW, as MinGW as a wrong prototype is in the non-standard
	file winsock.h

-	include/schily/stdio.h now implements code that partially unhides
	the FILE * data structures from the 64 bit Solaris libc.
	This allows to implement a getc_unlocked() macro even for 64 bit
	Solaris as done by libc, so libschily is able to achieve similar
	stdio I/O performance, which is needed to be able to implement
	a printf() in libschily that is faster than printf() from libc.

-	New functions xcomerr(), xcomerrno(), fxcomerr(), fxcomerrno()
	in libschily allow error message and exit with an exit value
	that differs from errno.

-	a bug in libschily/format.c that caused %.*s to be printed
	incorrectly has been fixed.

-	libschily/format.c has been redesigned to allow the code to be
	reused for fprformat() via #include.

-	libschily/fprformat.c
	New function fprformat() in libschily is implementing the same
	direct interface as doprnt() from libc and thus allows to implement
	printf() faster than the printf() from libc on Solaris.

-	libschily/jsprintf.c
	For Solaris, jsprintf() now is implemented based on fprformat().
	This allows printf() from libschily to be aprox. 33% faster than
	printf() from libc on Solaris and aprox. 2x as fast as jsprintf()
	in libschily has been before. This gives another performance boost
	for printf() bound programs like hdump/od that is used as a OSS
	replacement for the closed source od(1) on OpenSolaris. This
	now makes the OSS od(1) on OpenSolaris typically 5x faster then
	the closed source version.

-	libschily/getdtablesize.c now treats MinGW the same as when compiling
	on Win-DOS using cl.exe.

-	libschily/mkdirat.c and libschily/mkdirs.c now take care of the fact
	that MinGW has a non standard compliant mkdir()

-	libschily/mkfifoat.c fixed a type from, cut/paste the file from mkdirat.c

-	cdrecord/cue.c now has a better comment related to cdrtools specific
	CUE enhancements.

-	Fixed a typo in cdrecord.dfl

-	Avoid a redefined xxx warning for cdda2wav/exitcodes.h

-	Added a #undef interface to cdda2wav/interface.h to make sure that
	the #define interface from windows.h does not cause problems even
	when using MinGW

-	mkisofs/mkisofs.8 fixed illegal troff sequence "\\" to "\e"

-	Try to avoid a direct string "/dev/null" in mkisofs.c to allow
	it to work on Win-DOS without POSIX layer.

-	readcd -c2scan now also prints the percentage of sectors with C2 errors.

-	added new HP-UX specific #defines to cpp
