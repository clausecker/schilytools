New features with AN-2015-01-29:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thouroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	The file include/schily/dlfcn.h now defines HAVE_LOADABLE_LIBS
	if either POSIX loadable libs, or HP-UX loadable libs or Win-DOS
	loadable libs are present. The latter two will get a POSIX emulation
	layer if available.

-	Smake now allows to disable the built-in echo command by specifying

		make COPTX=-DNO_MYECHO

-	Mention in the Bourne Shell manual page that the new version
	of the Bourne Shell does evaluation of parameter assignement in the
	expected left to right order and not in the historical right to left 
	order anymore. This aligns the Bourne Shell with the Korn Shell.

-	sh/word.c was indented for better Cstyle compatibility.

-	sh/word.c was restructured for better readability and maintainability
	by creating new functions: match_word()/match_literal()/match_block()

-	bsh -version now also prints the timestamp of version.h

-	Better comment in bsh/inputc.c

-	The SCCS script "sccsdiff" has been changed to call "get -o -Gfile ..."
	instead of "get -g > file ..." in order to allow diff -u to print
	useful timestamps for the diffed versions.

-	The sccs command now also uses vfork() this has been prepared before
	but the final change fork() -> vfork() was forgotten before.

-	The sccs command now prints basic help (basic sub-commands) if
	called without arguments.

-	The SCCS man pages have been reworked and some more Sun-introduced
	bugs have been fixed. The troff man page files no longer contain
	endless long lines and correctly follows the man(5) rules again.

-	The man page sccs-admin.1 now correclty mentions that:

	%M%	Is expanded to the value of the 'm' flag in the history file.

	%Q%	Is expanded to the value of the 'q' flag in the history file.

	%Y%	Is expanded to the value of the 't' flag in the history file.

	Before, Sun did destroy the strings %M%, %Q%, %Y% with their conversion
	from troff to xml and back to troff using defective converters.

-	Various enhancements have been made to the SCCS manual pages:

	-	\f[BRI] font switching from the buggy Sun
		troff -> xml -> troff conversion has been mostly converted
		to man(5) compatible .B .I .R ...

	-	Non-standard hanging tags from the buggy Sun
		troff -> xml -> troff conversion have been converted to man(5)
		compaitble .TP tags.

	-	changeset.1 was renamed to sccschangeset.1, changeset.1 now
		contains a .so statement.

	-	sccsvct.1 was renamed to sccs-cvt.1, sccscvt.1 now
		contains a .so statement.

	-	sccslog.1 was renamed to sccs-log.1, sccslog.1 now
		contains a .so statement.

	-	sccs.1 now mentions that this version of SCCS will
		automatically create the SCCS subdirectory if needed.

	-	Hyphenation is now disabled in the SEE ALSO section.
		This helps to get working HTML links when using man2html(1).

-	Changes after this line have been made after SCCS-5.07

-	The SCCS manpage sccsfile.4 has been changed to use bold text
	for the haning tags on the first page. 

-	All SCCS programs have been fixed to provide a sufficient amount of
	string space for the SID -> string conversion. AT&T used 32 bytes
	but historic SCCS was only planned for a maximum SID component
	value of 30000. That would need a string space of 24 bytes. Today,
	we permit max unsigned with 31 bit that needs a maximum string
	space of 44 bytes if all SID components use the maximum value
	(but this is impopssible). The maximum possible value (all components
	at aprox. 500000000) would still consume 40 bytes.

-	A new #define SID_STRSIZE (45) helps to avoid buffer overflows with
	large SIDs. Before, most SID string buffers have only been 32 chars.

-	When the SCCSv6 history format is used, negative GMT offsets (e.g. USA)
	are now printed correctly. This was a fix in libcomobj.

-	The SCCS struct packet now includes p_insser - the serial number
	for the last extracted line.

-	New SCCS source file sccs/lib/comobj/src/lhash.c implements a
	string hash for programmer names.

-	SCCS libcomobj now allows to keep a list of programmer names for
	each SID. This is done with hashed strings to limit the needed
	memory space for that operation.

-	The SCCS get command now implements an experimental option -A
	that annotates the gotten lines with programmer names and dates.

-	The SCCS get command restructured the code to make it cleaner.

-	Some SCCS tests in the directory sccs/tests have been modified to avoid
	error messages like rmdir: directory not empty.


-	The mkisofs program isoinfo no longer tries to print Rock Ridge
	attribute data for ISO images that do not have correct RR data.

-	The mkisofs program isovfy no longer tries to print Rock Ridge
	attribute data for ISO images that do not have correct RR data.

-	The mkisofs program isodump no longer tries to print Rock Ridge
	attribute data for ISO images that do not have correct RR data.

	This is a result from trying to use these programs on the
	plan9 CD image.

-	cdrtools have been bumped to version 3.01a27
