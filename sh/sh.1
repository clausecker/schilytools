.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B /usr/bin/sh
utility is a command programming language that
executes commands read from a terminal or a file.
.LP
The name
.B bosh
permits to call this implementation even when
.B /usr/bin/sh
has been linked to another shell.
.LP
The
.B jsh
utility is an interface to the shell that provides all of the
functionality of
.B sh
and enables job control (see
.B Job Control
section below) by default.
Job control may also be enabled by calling the shell via the standard name
and then calling
.B set\ \-m
or
.BR "set\ \-o\ monitor" .
Since
.B POSIX
requires that job control is auto-enabled for interactive shells,
.B jsh
can be seen as an artefact from the historic Bourne Shell, but is kept for
compatibility.
.LP
.B pbosh
is a shell with strict POSIX mode enabled by default and with
.B bosh
specific enhancements disabled.
It may be used to check scripts for portability with the minimal
.B POSIX
feature set.
.LP
Arguments to the shell are listed in the
.B Invocation
section below.
.SS "Definitions"
.sp
.LP
A
.I blank
is a tab or a space. A
.I name
is a sequence of
.B ASCII
letters, digits, or underscores, beginning with a letter or an
underscore. A
.I parameter
is a name, a digit, or any of the characters
.BR * ,
.BR @ ,
.BR # ,
.BR ? ,
.BR \(mi ,
.BR $ ,
and
.BR ! .

.SS "Invocation"
.sp
.LP
If the shell is invoked through
.BR exec (2)
and the first character of
argument zero is
.BR \(mi ,
commands are initially read from
.B /etc/profile and from
.BR $HOME/.profile ,
if such files exist.
Next, for interactive shells, commands are read from
.B /etc/sh.shrc
and from the file with a name that results from doing
.B Parameter Substitution
on the environment variable
.B ENV
if the file exists (by default this is the file
.BR $HOME/.shrc ).
Thereafter, commands are read as described below, which is also the case
when the shell is invoked as
.BR /usr/bin/sh .

.SH OPTIONS
The options below are
interpreted by the shell on invocation only.
.B Note:
Unless the
.B \-c
or
.B \-s
option is specified, the first argument is assumed to be the name
of a file containing commands, and the remaining arguments are passed as
positional parameters to that command file:
.br
.ne 3
.TP 12
.BI \-c " string"
If the
.B \-c
option is present commands are read from
.IR string ,
where
.I string
is the first non-option argument after
.BR \-c .
The remaining arguments become positional parameters starting at
.BR $0 .
.sp
Optional options between
.B \-c
and
.I string
have not been supported by older versions of
.BR sh .
.br
.ne 5
.TP
.B \-i
If the
.B \-i
option is present or if the shell input and output are
attached to a terminal, this shell is
.BR interactive .
In this case,
TERMINATE is ignored (so that
.B kill 0
does not kill an interactive
shell) and INTERRUPT is caught and ignored (so that
.B wait
is interruptible). In all cases, QUIT is ignored by the shell.
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-p
If the
.B \-p
option is present, the shell does not set the effective user
and group IDs to the real user and group IDs.
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-r
If the
.B \-r
option is present the shell is a restricted shell (see
.BR rsh (8)).
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-s
If the
.B \-s
option is present or if no arguments remain, commands are
read from the standard input. Any remaining arguments specify the positional
parameters. Shell output (except for
.BR "Special Commands" )
is written to file descriptor 2.
.TP
.B \-version
Print the current
.B Bourne Shell
version and exit.
.LP
Using
.B +
rather than
.B \-
causes the related options to be turned off.
The remaining options and arguments are described under the
.B set
command below.

.SH USAGE
.SS "Commands"
.sp
.LP
A
.I simple-command
is a sequence of non-blank
.IR word s
separated by
.IR blank s.
The first
.I word
specifies the name of the command to be
executed. Except as specified below, the remaining
.IR word s
are passed as
arguments to the invoked command. The command name is passed as argument 0
(see
.BR exec (2)).
The
.I value
of a
.I simple-command
is its exit
status if it terminates normally, or (octal)
.BR 200 +\c
.I status
if it terminates abnormally. See
.BR signal.h (3HEAD)
for a list of status values.
.sp
.LP
A
.I pipeline
is a sequence of one or more
.IR command s
separated by
.BR | .
The standard output of each
.I command
but the last is connected by a
.BR pipe (2)
to the standard input of the next
.IR command .
If the
.B extended pipe syntax
is enabled via
.BR "set\ \-o\ fdpipe" ,
the pipe symbol
.RB ( | )
may be preceded by a digit that specifies the file descriptor
which should be associated to the command from the left side
instead of the default
.BR stdout ,
e.g.
.B 2|
for a pipe from
.BR stderr .
Each
.I command
is run as a separate process. The shell waits for the last
.I command
to terminate. The exit status of a
.I pipeline
is the exit status of the last command in the
.IR pipeline .
Each pipeline can be preceded by the reserved word
.BR ! .
This causes the exit status of the pipeline to become
.B 0
if the exit status of the last command is
.BR non-zero ,
and
.B 1
if the exit status of the last command is
.BR 0 .
.sp
.LP
A
.I list
is a sequence of one or more
.IR pipeline s
separated by
.BR ; ,
.BR & ,
.BR && ,
or
.BR |\|| ,
and optionally terminated by
.B ;
or
.BR & \&.
Of these four symbols,
.B ;
and
.B &
have equal precedence, which is lower than that of
.B &&
and
.BR |\|| .
The symbols
.B &&
and
.B |\||
also have equal precedence. A semicolon
.RB ( ; )
causes sequential execution of the preceding
.IR pipeline ,
that is, the shell waits for the
.I pipeline
to finish before executing any commands
following the semicolon. An ampersand
.RB ( & )
causes asynchronous
execution of the preceding pipeline, that is, the shell does
.B not
wait for that pipeline to finish. The symbol
.B &&
.RB ( \||\|| )
causes the
.I list
following it to be executed only if the preceding pipeline
returns a zero (non-zero) exit status. An arbitrary number of newlines can
appear in a
.IR list ,
instead of semicolons, to delimit commands.
.sp
.LP
A
.I command
is either a
.I simple-command
or one of the following.
Unless otherwise stated, the value returned by a command is that of the last
.I simple-command
executed in the command.
.sp
.ne 3
.HP
.B for
.I name
[
.B in
.I word
\&.\|.\|. ]
.B do
.I list
.B done
.br
Each time a
.B for
command is executed,
.I name
is set to the next
.I word
taken from the
.B in
.I word
list. If
.B in
.I word
\&.\|.\|. is omitted, then the
.B for
command executes the
.B do
.I list
once for each positional parameter that is set (see
.B Parameter Substitution
section below). Execution ends when there are no more words
in the list.
.sp
.ne 3
.HP
.B select
.I name
[
.B in
.I word
\&.\|.\|. ]
.B do
.I list
.B done
.br
The select command prints on standard error (file descriptor\ 2),
the set of
.IR words ,
each preceded by a number.
If
.BI in " word"
\&... is omitted, then the positional parameters are used instead.
See
.BR "Parameter Substitution" .
The
.B PS3
prompt is printed and a line is read from the standard input.
If this line consists of the number of one of the listed
.IR words ,
then the value of the variable
.I name
is set to the
.I word
corresponding to this number.
If this line is empty. the selection list is printed again.
Otherwise the value of the variable
.I name
is set to
.BR NULL .
.RB (See " Blank Interpretation " about " NULL" ). 
The contents of the line read from standard input is saved in the shell variable
.BR REPLY .
The list is executed for each selection until a
.B break
or
.B EOF
is encountered. If the
.B REPLY
variable is set to
.B NULL
by the execution of list, then the selection list is printed before
displaying the
.B PS3
prompt for the next selection.
.sp
The
.B select
keyword was not supported by older versions of
.B sh
and is not required by
.BR POSIX .

.br

[
.RB [ ( ]
.I pattern
[ |
.I pattern

.B )
.I list
.B ;\|;
] .\|.\|.
.B esac
.br
A
.B case
command executes the
.I list
associated with the first
.I pattern
that matches
.IR word .
The form of the patterns is the same
as that used for file-name generation (see
.B File Name Generation
section), except that a slash, a leading dot, or a dot immediately following
a slash need not be matched explicitly.
.sp
The
.B ;;
operator causes execution of case to terminate.
If
.B ;& 
is used in place of
.B ;;
the next subsequent list, if any, is executed.
This causes a fall through to the next command list.
If
.B ;;&
is used in place of
.BR ;; ,
the shell tests the next pattern list in the statement, if any,
and executes any associated list on a successful match.
.sp
When not in 
.B POSIX
mode,
.B sh
implements a fallback to a simple string compare,
in case that an attempt to match the pattern similar to
.BR fnmatch (3)
fails.
.sp
The optional opening parenthesis was not supported by older versions of
.BR sh .
It has been added as it is required by
.BR POSIX .

.B then
.I list
[
.B elif
.I list
.B then
.I list

.B fi
.br
The
.I list
following
.B if
is executed and, if it returns a zero
exit status, the
.I list
following the first
.B then
is executed.
Otherwise, the
.I list
following
.B elif
is executed and, if its value is zero, the
.I list
following the next
.B then
is executed. Failing that, the
.B else
.I list
is executed. If no
.B else
.I list
or
.B then
.I list
is executed, then the
.B if
command returns a zero exit status.

A
.B while
command repeatedly executes the
.B while
.I list
and, if the exit status of the last command in the list is zero, executes the
.B do
.IR list ;
otherwise the loop terminates. If no commands in the
.B do
.I list
are executed, then the
.B while
command returns a zero exit status;
.B until
can be used in place of
.B while
to negate the loop termination test.

.B (\|) {
.IB list ;}
.br
Define a function which is referenced by

The body of the function is the

of commands between
.B {
and
.BR } .
The
.B {
must be followed by a space. Execution of functions is described below (see
.B Execution
section). The
.B {

.B }
are unnecessary
if the body of the function is a
.I command
as defined above, under
.BR Commands .
.br
.ne 3
.HP
.BI time " pipeline"
.br
The
.I pipeline
is executed and the elapsed time as well as the user and system time
are printed to standard error.
The
.B TIMEFORMAT
variable can be set to a format string that specifies how the
timing information should be displayed.
Command based timing from
.B "set\ \-o\ time"
is temporarily disabled while pipeline based timing is in effect.
If
.B time
is followed by white space and a
.RB ' \- ',
it is interpreted as a normal command in order to permit
.BR "time\ \-p" ,
as required by POSIX.
.LP
.B POSIX
does not require
.B time
to be a keyword.
.LP
The following words are only recognized as the first word of a command and
when not quoted:
.sp
.LP
.in +2
.nf
.B
!          if       then     else    elif    fi      case

.B
select     time
.\"function   [[  ]]
.fi
.in -2
.LP
The reserved words
.BR ! ,
.B select
and
.B time
were not supported in older versions of
.BR sh .
.SS "Comments Lines"
.sp
.LP
A word beginning with
.B #
causes that word and all the following
characters up to a newline to be ignored.
.SS "# commands"
.sp
.LP
If the hash character
.B #
is the
.B first character
in a command line and hash commands
have been enabled via
.BR "set\ \-o\ hashcmds" ,
the whole line is processed by the hash command interpreter.
This allows one to have an alternate entry to the
.B alias
definitions that avoids complex quoting by working on
the raw alias definitions.
.LP
Hash commands are frequently used to edit alias definitions using the
command line history editor.
.LP
.B No I/O redirection
is possible for hash commands.
.B No exit code
is created for hash commands,
.B $?
is left intact from the last regular command.
Quoting is not possible for hash commands.
For all hash commands, there is a built in help text that is printed
when 
.BI # c "\ -help"
is called, where
.I c
is one of the command letters.
.LP
When hash commands are enabled, the character that immediately follows the
.B #
is the
.BR "command character" .
The command character may be followed by one or more
.BR "command modifier characters" .
The following commands are supported:

.br
.ne 3
.TP
.BI "#a[g|l]" " name value"
Add a new
.B all expand
alias. Such an alias is expanded regardless where it
occurs on the command line.
Without modifier, the alias
is entered into the current default table.
.sp
The first word surrounded by spaces is taken as the
.B alias
.IR name ,
after skipping spaces, all text up to the end of the line is taken as
the
.B alias
.IR value .
.sp
When using the
.RB ' g '
modifier, the command works on
.BR "global aliases" ,
regardless of the current default.
.sp
When using the
.RB ' l '
modifier, the command works on
.BR "local aliases" ,
regardless of the current default.
.sp
At startup, the default is to use
the
.BR "global aliases" .
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.BI "#b[g|l]" " name value"
Add a new
.BR "begin alias" .
Such an alias is only expanded for the first word
in a command.
Without modifier, the alias
is entered into the current default table.
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.BI "#d[g|l]" " name"
Removes the alias
.I name
from the list of known aliases.
Without modifier, the alias
is removed from the current default table.
.br
.ne 5
.TP
.B #h
.PD 0
.TP
.B #?
.PD
Print an overview help for all
.B #
commands.
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.BI "#l[g|l][h] [" "name" ]
Lists aliases from the table.
Without modifier, the aliases
from the current default table are printed.
Without
.IR name ,
all aliases are listed. With
.IR name ,
only matching aliases are listed. Wildcards may be used.
.sp
When using the
.RB ' h '
modifier, the alias is also entered into the command history.
This permits editing of existing aliases with the history
editor and to re-enter the modified entries into the
list of aliases.
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.BI "#p[g|l][a|b]" " name value"
With the
.B #p
command, an alias may be pushed on top of an existing alias
without writing to the related file. When a pushed value
is removed, the old definition reappears.
.sp
When using the
.RB ' a '
modifier, an
.B all expand
alias is pushed.
.sp
When using the
.RB ' b '
modifier, a
.B begin
alias is pushed.
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.B #s[g|l]
Set or list the default table for other 
.B #
command alias operations.
If no modifier letter is used, the current default is printed
otherwise the new default is set.
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.B #
In interactive mode,
when entered as
.B first character
on the command line, this prints the shell version.
.sp
After the command
.B set\ \-o\ hashcmds
has been issued in a shell script, a
.B #
as
.B first character
of a command line inside that shell script,
if followed by a non-space character is no longer
interpreted as a comment. This may be a problem in the file
.B $HOME/.shrc
as this file is typically used to enable
.B hashcmds
via
.B set\ \-o\ hashcmds
for an interactive shell.
It is thus recommended to have
.B set\ \-o\ hashcmds
close to the bottom of the file
.BR $HOME/.shrc .

.SS "Alias Substitution"
.LP
After a token has been recognized, but before applying the grammatical rules,
a resulting word that is identified as the command name of a simple command
is examined whether it is an unquoted valid alias name.
A valid alias name is replaced by the value of the alias.
The shell prevents infinite alias loops by not expanding the same alias 
more than once for the same word.
.LP
Alias expansion is performed when the commands are read, not when they
are executed.
.LP
Aliases can be used to redefine
.B built-in
commands but cannot be used to redefine the reserved words listed in the
.B Commands
section. Aliases can be created and listed with the
.B alias
command and removed with the
.B unalias
command.
.LP
.B POSIX
compliant temporary
.B alias
definitions are not inherited by separate invocations of the shell or
when interpreting scripts.
.LP
The Bourne Shell implements enhanced alias features beyond the POSIX
alias definition. Enhanced alias features are disabled by default.
They need to be turned on (see
.B set
command below) to make them operational.
The following additional alias features are available:
.TP
.B persistent aliases
If turned on by
.BR "set \-o globalaliases" ,
persistent global aliases are automatically loaded by all interactive shells.
.TP
.B local aliases
If turned on by
.BR "set \-o localaliases" ,
persistent local aliases are automatically loaded by all interactive shells
as a result of the
.B cd
command.
Local aliases are specific to the current working directory. The local
aliases definitions from the previous working directory are automatically
disabled when the working directory is changed to a different directory.
Local aliases have higher precedence than global aliases.

.br
.ne 4
.SS "Tilde Expansion"
.sp
.LP
A
.I tilde-prefix
consists of an unquoted tilde character at the beginning of a word,
followed by all of the characters preceding the first
unquoted slash in the word, or all the characters in the word if there is no
slash. In an assignment, multiple tilde-prefixes can be used: at the
beginning of the word (that is, following the equal sign of the assignment),
following any unquoted colon or both. A tilde-prefix in an assignment is
terminated by the first unquoted colon or slash. If none of the characters
in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the tilde-prefix following
the tilde are treated as a possible login name from the user database.
.sp
.LP
A portable login name cannot contain characters outside the set given in
the description of the
.B LOGNAME
environment variable. If the login name
is null (that is, the tilde-prefix contains only the tilde), the
tilde-prefix is replaced by the value of the variable
.BR HOME .
If
\fBHOME\fR is unset, the results are unspecified. Otherwise, the
tilde-prefix is replaced by a pathname of the home directory associated with
the login name obtained using the
.B getpwnam
function. If the system
does not recognize the login name, the results are undefined.
.sp
.LP
Tilde expansion generally occurs only at the beginning of words, but an
exception based on historical practice has been included:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
.B
PATH=/usr/xpg4/bin:~joerg/bin
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
is eligible for tilde expansion because tilde follows a colon and none of
the relevant characters is quoted. Consideration was given to prohibiting
this behavior because any of the following are reasonable substitutes:
.sp
.ne 5
.in +2
.nf
.B
PATH=$(printf %s ~karels/bin : ~bostic/bin)
.B
for Dir in ~maart/bin ~srb/bin .
.B
do
.B
     PATH=${PATH:+$PATH:}$Dir
.B
done
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
With the first command, explicit colons are used for each directory. In all
cases, the shell performs tilde expansion on each directory because all are
separate words to the shell.
.sp
.LP
Expressions in operands such as:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
.B
make -k mumble LIBDIR=~chet/lib
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
do not qualify as shell variable assignments and tilde expansion is not
performed (unless the command does so itself, which
.B make
does not).
.sp
.LP
Because of the requirement that the word not be quoted, the following are
not equivalent; only the last causes tilde expansion:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB\e~hlj/   ~h\elj/   ~"hlj"/   ~hlj\e/   ~hlj/\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The results of giving tilde with an unknown login name are undefined by
.B POSIX
because the
.B Bourne Shell
.B ~+
and
.B ~\-
constructs make use of this condition, but in general it is an error to
give an incorrect login name with tilde. The results of having
.B HOME
unset are unspecified because
some historical shells treat this as an error.
.sp
.LP
If a tilde that matches the criteria is found,
the word up to a
.B /
(or up to a
.B :
in case of a variable assignment)
is checked to see if it matches a user
name in the password database. If a match is found, the
.B ~
and the
matched login name are replaced by the login directory of the matched user.
If no match is found, the original text is left unchanged. A
.B ~
by
itself, or in front of a
.BR / ,
is replaced by
.BR $HOME .
A
.BR ~
followed by a
.B +
or
.B -
is replaced by the value of
.B $PWD
and
.B $OLDPWD
respectively.

.SS "Command Substitution"
.sp
.LP
The shell reads
.I commands
enclosed in parenthesis preceded by a dollar sign (that is,
.BI $( command)\c
) or from the string between two grave accents
.RB ( `` )
and the standard output from these commands can be used as all or
part of a word. Trailing newlines from the standard output are removed.
.sp
.LP
No interpretation is done on the string before the string is read,
except when using the second (obsolete) form using the backquoted syntax,
where backslashes
.RB ( \e )
are used to escape other characters.
.LP
When using the backquoted syntax,
backslashes can be used to escape a grave accent
.RB ( ` )
or another backslash
.RB ( \e )
and are removed before the command string is read.
Escaping grave accents allows nested command substitution in this form.
If the command
substitution lies within a pair of double quotes (\c
.B
" .\|.\|.\|` .\|.\|.\|` \&.\|.\|.\| "\c
), a backslash used to escape a double quote (\fB\e"\fR) is
.\" " <-- hack for various editors. please keep.
removed. Otherwise, it is left intact.
.sp
.LP
If a backslash is used to escape a newline character
.RB ( \enewline ),
both the backslash and the newline are removed (see the later section on
.BR Quoting ).
In addition, backslashes used to escape dollar signs
.RB ( \e$ )
are removed. Since no parameter substitution is done on the
command string before it is read, inserting a backslash to escape a dollar
sign has no effect. Backslashes that precede characters other than
.BR \e ,
.BR ` ,
\fB"\fR,
.\" " <-- hack for various editors. please keep.
.BR newline ,
and
.B $
are left intact when the command string is read.
.LP
In the
.B $()
form, nested command substitutions do not need special quoting.
.LP
Command substitution allows the output of a command to be substituted 
in place of the command name itself. Command substitution occurs when
the command is enclosed as follows:
.LP
.in +2
.BI $( command )
.in -2
.LP
or (backquoted version):
.LP
.in +2
.BI ` command `
.in -2
.LP
The shell expands the command substitution by executing
.I command
in a subshell environment and replacing the command substitution
(the text of command plus the enclosing
.B $()
or backquotes) with the standard output of the command, removing
sequences of one or more newline characters at the end of the
substitution. Embedded newline characters before the end of the 
output is not be removed; however, they can be treated as field
delimiters and eliminated during field splitting, depending on 
the value of
.B IFS
and quoting that is in effect.
.LP
With the
.BI $( command )
form, all characters following the open parenthesis to the matching
closing parenthesis constitute the command. Any valid shell script
can be used for
.IR command .
.LP
The results of command substitution are not field splitting and pathname
expansion processed for further tilde expansion, parameter expansion,
command substitution or arithmetic  expansion. If a command substitution
occurs inside double-quotes, it is not be performed on the results of the
substitution.
.LP
The
.B $()
form of command substitution solves a problem of inconsistent behavior when
using backquotes. For example:
.TS
tab() box;
cw(2.75i) cw(2.75i)
lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i)
.
CommandOutput
_
echo '\e$x'\e$x
echo `echo '\e$x'`$x
echo $(echo '\e$x')\e$x
.TE
.LP
Additionally, the backquoted syntax has historical restrictions on the
contents of the embedded command. While the new
.B $()
form can process
any kind of valid embedded script, the backquoted form cannot handle some
valid scripts that include backquotes. For example, these otherwise valid
embedded scripts do not work in the left column, but do work on the right:
.TS
tab() box;
lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i)
lw(2.75i) lw(2.75i)
.
echo `echo $(
cat <<eofcat <<eof
a here-doc with `a here-doc with )
eofeof
`)
echo `echo $(
echo abc # a comment with `echo abc # a comment with )
`)
echo `echo $(
echo '`'echo ')'
`)
.TE
.LP
Because of these inconsistent behaviors, the backquoted variety of command
substitution is not recommended for new applications that nest command
substitutions or attempt to embed complex scripts.
.LP
If the command substitution consists of a single subshell, such as:
.LP
.in +2
.BI "$( (" command ") )
.in -2
.LP
a portable application must separate the
.B $(
and
.B (
into two tokens (that is, separate them with white space). This is
required to avoid any ambiguities with arithmetic expansion.

.SS "Arithmetic Expansion"
.sp
.LP
An arithmetic expression enclosed in double parentheses preceded by a
dollar sign is replaced by
the value of the arithmetic expression within the double parenthesis.
.B Arithmetic expansion
provides a mechanism for evaluating an arithmetic
expression and substituting its value. The format for arithmetic expansion
is as follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
.BI $(( arithmetic-expression ))
.fi
.in -2
.sp
.LP
The expression is treated as if it were in double-quotes, except that a
double-quote inside the expression is not treated specially. The shell
expands all tokens in the expression for parameter expansion, command
substitution and quote removal.
.sp
.LP
Next, the shell treats this as an arithmetic expression and substitutes the
value of the expression. The arithmetic expression is processed according to
the rules of the ISO C with the following exceptions:
.RS
.TP
.B
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Only
.B signed long long integer
arithmetic is supported.
.TP
.B
.ie t \(bu
.el o
The
.B sizeof()
operator is not supported.
.TP
.B
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Selection, iteration, and jump statements are not supported.
.RE
.LP
If the expression is invalid, the expansion fails and the
shell writes a message to standard error indicating the failure.
.LP
.B POSIX
does not require to support the prefix and postfix
.B ++
and
.B \(mi\|\(mi
operators, so avoid them in portable shell scripts.
.LP
.B POSIX
does not require to support more than
.B signed long
arithmetic, so avoid arithmetic that requires more in portable scripts.
.LP
In older versions of
.BR sh ,
.B arithmetic expansion
was not supported.
.LP
A simple example using arithmetic expansion:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
# repeat a command 100 times
x=100
while [ $x \(migt 0 ]
do
     command
     x=$((x\(mi1))
done
.fi
.in -2

.SS "Parameter Substitution"
.sp
.LP
The character
.B $
is used to introduce substitutable
.IR parameter s.
There are two types of parameters, positional and keyword. If
.I parameter
is a digit, it is a positional parameter. Positional
parameters can be assigned values by
.BR set .
Keyword parameters (also
known as variables) can be assigned values by writing:
.sp
.LP
.IB name = value
[
.IB name = value
] .\|.\|.
.sp
.LP
The evaluation of the assignments is done from the left to the right
in this shell.
.LP
Pattern-matching is not performed on
.IR value .
There cannot be a function and a variable with the same
.IR name .

The decimal value returned by the last synchronously executed command or
a decimal number derived from the signal number that killed the process.
.sp
Only the low 8 bits of the exit code from the command are visible
unless exit code masking is switched off by
.RB `` "set\ \-o\ fullexitcode" ''.
The ability to see all 32 bits from the exit code requires a modern

compliant operating system with working support for
.BR waitid (2).

If the executable file could not be found, the returned value is
.BR 127 .
If the file exists but could not be executed, the returned value is
.BR 126 .

If
.B bosh

this is (on a POSIX system) the 32 bit
exit code from the last command that did normally exit. Older non-POSIX

low 8 bits from the exit code.
In any case, the number was a result from a normal program exit.

.sp
.in +2
.nf
.BI "\&... 1>" "xxx" " 2>&1"
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
first associates file descriptor 1 with file

.IR xxx .
.sp
.LP
Using the terminology introduced on the first page, under
.BR Commands ,
if a
.I command
is composed of several
.IR "simple commands" ,
redirection is evaluated for the entire
.I command
before it is evaluated for each
.IR "simple command" .
That is, the shell evaluates redirection for the entire
.IR list ,
then each

.SS "File Name Generation"
.sp
.LP
Before a command is executed, each command
.I word

.BR * ,
.BR ? ,

.BR [ .
If one of these characters appears
the word is regarded as a
.IR pattern .
The word is replaced with
alphabetically sorted file names that match the pattern. If no file name is
found that matches the pattern, the word is left unchanged. The character
.B \&.
at the start of a file name or immediately following a
.BR / ,
as well as the character
.B /
itself, must be matched explicitly.
.br
.ne 3

Matches any string, including the null string.

.br
.ne 3
.TP
.B ?
Matches any single character.

.br
.ne 3
.TP
.BR [ .\|.\|. ]
Matches any one of the enclosed characters. A pair of characters separated
by
.B \(mi
matches any character lexically between the pair, inclusive.
If the first character following the opening
.B [
is a
.BR ! ,
any character not enclosed is matched.

.sp
.LP
Notice that all quoted characters (see below) must be matched explicitly in
a filename.
.SS "Quoting"
.sp
.LP
The following characters have a special meaning to the shell and cause
termination of a word unless quoted:
.sp
.LP
.B ";  &  (  )  |  ^  <  >  newline  space  tab"
.sp
.LP
A character can be
.I quoted
(that is, made to stand for itself) by
preceding it with a backslash
.RB ( \e )
or inserting it between a pair of
quote marks
.RB ( \|'\|'
or \fB""\fR). During processing, the shell can
quote certain characters to prevent them from taking on a special meaning.
Backslashes used to quote a single character are removed from the word
before the command is executed. The pair
.B \enewline
is removed from a word before command and parameter substitution.
.sp
.LP
All characters enclosed between a pair of single quote marks
.RB ( \|'\|' ),
except a single quote, are quoted by the shell. Backslash
has no special meaning inside a pair of single quotes. A single quote can be
quoted inside a pair of double quote marks (for example, \fB"\|'"\fR), but a
single quote can not be quoted inside a pair of single quotes.
.sp
.LP
Inside a pair of double quote marks (\fB""\fR), parameter and command
substitution occurs and the shell quotes the results to avoid blank
interpretation and file name generation. If
.B $*
is within a pair of
double quotes, the positional parameters are substituted and quoted,
separated by quoted spaces (\fB"$1 \|$2\fR \|.\|.\|.\fB"\fR). However, if
.B $@
is within a pair of double quotes, the positional parameters are
substituted and quoted, separated by unquoted spaces (\fB"$1"\|"$2"\fR \|
\&.\|.\|. ).
.B \e
quotes the characters
.BR \e ,
.BR ` ,
.B ,
(comma), and
.BR $ .
The pair
.B \enewline
is removed before parameter
and command substitution. If a backslash precedes characters other than
.BR \e ,
.BR ` ,
.B ,
(comma),
.BR $ ,
and newline, then the backslash
itself is quoted by the shell.
.SS "Prompting"
.sp
.LP
When used interactively, the shell prompts with the value of
.B PS1
before reading a command. If at any time a newline is typed and further
input is needed to complete a command, the secondary prompt (that is, the
value of
.BR PS2 )
is issued.
.SS "Environment"
.sp
.LP
The
.I environment
(see
.BR environ (7))
is a list of name-value pairs
that is passed to an executed program in the same way as a normal argument
list. The shell interacts with the environment in several ways. On
invocation, the shell scans the environment and creates a parameter for each
name found, giving it the corresponding value. If the user modifies the
value of any of these parameters or creates new parameters, none of these
affects the environment unless the
.B export
command is used to bind the
shell's parameter to the environment (see also
.BR "set \-a" ).
A parameter can be removed from the environment with the
.B unset
command.
The environment seen by any executed command is thus composed of any
unmodified name-value pairs originally inherited by the shell, minus any
pairs removed by
.BR unset ,
plus any modifications or additions, all of
which must be noted in
.B export
commands.
.LP
When the shell starts in
.B POSIX
mode, all variables imported from the environment are given the
.B export
property and the shell internal values cannot be modified independently
from the values propagated via the environment to child processes.
.sp
.LP
The environment for any
.I simple-command
can be augmented by prefixing
it with one or more assignments to parameters. Thus:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
.BI TERM=450 " command"

Otherwise, signals have the

11 (but see also the
.B trap
command below).
.SS "Execution"
.sp
.LP
Each time a command is executed, the command substitution, parameter
substitution, blank interpretation, input/output redirection, and filename
generation listed above are carried out. If the command name matches the
name of a defined function, the function is executed in the shell process
(note how this differs from the execution of shell script files, which
require a sub-shell for invocation). If the command name does not match the
name of a defined function, but matches one of the
.B Special Commands
listed below, it is executed in the shell process.
.sp
.LP
The positional parameters
.BR $1 ,
.BR $2 ,
\&.\|.\|. are set to the
arguments of the function. If the command name matches neither a
.B Special Command
nor the name of a defined function, a new process is created and
an attempt is made to execute the command via
.BR exec (2).
.sp
.LP
The shell parameter
.B PATH
defines the search path for the directory
containing the command. Alternative directory names are separated by a colon
.RB ( : ).
The default path is
.BR /usr/bin: .
The current directory is
specified by a null path name, which can appear immediately after the equal
sign, between two colon delimiters anywhere in the path list, or at the end
of the path list. If the command name contains a
.B /
the search path is
not used. Otherwise, each directory in the path is searched for an
executable file. If the file has execute permission but is not an
.B a.out
file, it is assumed to be a file containing shell commands. A
sub-shell is spawned to read it. A parenthesized command is also executed in
a sub-shell.
.sp
.LP
The location in the search path where a command was found is remembered by
the shell (to help avoid unnecessary
.IR exec s
later). If the command was
found in a relative directory, its location must be re-determined whenever
the current directory changes. The shell forgets all remembered locations
whenever the
.B PATH
variable is changed or the
.B hash \-r
command is executed (see below).
.SS "Built-in Commands"
.sp
.LP
The following commands are executed in the shell process.
Input/output redirection is permitted for these commands. File
descriptor 1 is the default output location. When Job Control is enabled,
additional

.B "alias \fR[\fI options \fR] [\fIalias-name\fR[=\fIvalue\fR]...]"
.sp .6
The
.B alias
command creates, redefines or lists existing alias definitions.
An alias definition provides a string value that replaces a command name
when it is encountered on the command line.
.sp
The
.B alias
command in the Bourne Shell supports temporary aliases (POSIX aliases)
that affect only the current execution environment as well as
persistent aliases that affect all interactive shells that are called after a
persistent alias definition was entered or modified.
.sp
An argument in the form
.I alias-name
causes
.B alias
to list the related alias on stdout.
An argument in the form
.IR alias-name = value
causes
.B alias
to define or redefine an alias or to push an alias definition on top of
an old one.
If no argument was given,
.B alias
lists all current alias definitions.
.sp
Alias definitions using the 
.B alias
shell built-in must be written with appropriate quoting so that it is
suitable for reinput to the shell parser.
.sp
The
.B # commands
provide an alternate interface to define aliases that does not use the
standard shell parser. It thus does not require quoting that goes beyond
the quoting needed for the final command line in the expanded command.
.sp
The
.B alias
command was not supported in older versions of
.BR sh .
.sp
When operating on temporary aliases (i.e. when neither
.B \-g
nor
.B \-l
have been specified), the
.B alias
command always pushes new definitions on top of older ones.
This makes such alias definitions temporary in the
global aliases name space by default, as required by the POSIX standard.
The following options may be used to modify operation:
.RS
.TP
.B \-a
Define an alias definition that is expanded on all arguments of a
command line and not only for command names. Use with care.
.TP
.B \-e
List the everlasting version of the persistent alias definitions instead of
listing the currently active definitions that may have been pushed on top
of the persistent definitions.
.TP
.B \-g
Define or list persistent global aliases that are stored in the file
.B $HOME/.globals
and read by interactive shells.
When defining an alias with
.B \-g
in effect,
.B alias
by default modifies the current top level definition for global aliases.
If there was no push operation before on the related alias,
the current definition is made persistent by writing the definitions to
.BR $HOME/.globals .
The option
.B \-g
is not permitted if persistent global aliases are disabled (see
.B set
command below).
.TP
.B \-l
Define or list persistent directory local aliases that are stored in the file
.B .locals
in the current directory and read by interactive shells.
When defining an alias with
.B \-l
in effect,
.B alias
by default modifies the current top level definition for local aliases.
If there was no push operation before on the related alias,
the current definition is made persistent by writing the definitions to
.B .locals
in the current directory.
The option
.B \-l
is not permitted if persistent local aliases are disabled (see
.B set
command below).
.TP
.B \-p
When defining or redefining aliases,
enforce a push operation even if the option
.B \-g
or
.B \-l
has been specified.
In push mode, the new alias definition is pushed temporarily on
top of existing definitions instead of modifying the current
definition.
.sp
When listing aliases, this option implements compatibility to bash/ksh93
and outputs aliases in a form that can be used as input to the shell
to recreate the current aliases.
With
.B \-p
in effect in list mode, the persistent definition and all pushed definitions
are listed; otherwise only the current active definitions are listed.
.TP
.B \-r
Reload persistent aliases after removing all current aliases.
If persistent aliases are disabled, the effect is the same as with
calling
.BR "unalias \-a" .
No arguments are allowed with this option.

.sp .6
The
.B find
command is available as a builtin command that is implemented via
.BR libfind .
.sp
The
.B find
implementation of this shell includes primary operators called
.B \-call
and
.B \-calldir
that allow directly calling back commands into the shell.
As this does not need to create a new process, it is much faster than the
.B \-exec
primary.
.sp
In the
.BR "Bourne Shell" ,
the command following the
.B \-call
primary is evaluated similar to the
.BR eval (1)
command in case the first argument to
.B \-call
does not contain a shell variable reference and similar to
.BI "sh -c " command " call " argument ...
or the
.BR dosh (1)
builtin in case there is a variable reference.
.sp
The
.BR eval (1)
mode is triggered with simple commands that do not contain variable references:
.sp
.nf
.B
    find . -call echo {} \e;
.fi
.sp
The
.BR dosh (1)
mode is triggered with commands that contain variable references:
.sp
.nf
.B
    find . -call 'test -d "$1" && echo dir: "$1"' {} \e;
.fi
.sp
The shell variable
.B $0
is set to the value
.B call
in this case and the equivalent
.B find
command using
.B \-exec
would be:
.sp
.nf
.B
    find . -exec sh -c 'test -d "$1" && echo dir: "$1"' call {} \e;
.fi
.sp
You may like to try both commands to see the performance win
using the

.BR find (1)
primary.

This command parses positional parameters and checks for

for usage and description.
.RS
.LP
The
.B getopts
builtin command parses its
.I args
or the global
.I args
of the current shell, using
.I optstring
as option definition.
Each time it is invoked, it places the next option character into the variable
.I name
and the index of the next argument to be processed into
.BR OPTIND .
Whenever the shell or a shell script is invoked,
.B OPTIND
is initialized to
.BR 1 .
Calling
.B getopts
repeatedly causes one option to be retrieved per call.
.LP
When an option requires an option-argument,
.I getopts
places it in the shell variable
.BR OPTARG .
.LP
If an illegal option is encountered,
.B ?
is placed in
.IR name .
If
.I optstring
starts with a colon and a required option-argument is missing, a colon
is placed in
.IR name .
.LP
When the end of options is encountered,
.B getopts
exits with a non-zero exit status.
The special arg
.B \-\-
can be used to delimit the end of the options.
.LP
.I optstring
must contain the option letters the command using
.B getopts
recognizes. If a letter is followed by a colon, the option is expected
to have an argument, or group of arguments, which must be separated
from it by white space.
.LP
Unless
.I optstring
starts with a colon,
.B getopts
prints an error message on the standard error when
it encounters an option letter not included in optstring.
.LP
If
.I optstring
starts with a
.RB `` + '',
options in the form
.BR +o ,
.B +long\-option
or
.B ++long\-option
are recognised and the
.B name
shell variable gets a value with a leading
.RB `` + ''
in case an option in the form
.BR +o ,
.B +long\-option
or
.B ++long\-option
is used.
.LP
If more than one flag character from
.B
":"\c
,
.B
"+"
or
.B
"()"
is used in
.IR optstring ,
.B
"()"
needs to be last.
.LP
.B getopts
supports one or more long options as an alias to a short option.
You must enclose each long option equivalent in parentheses, as follows:
.LP
  getopts "f:(file)(input-file)o:(output-file)"
.LP
In the above example, both
.B \-\-file
and
.B \-\-input\-file
are the equivalent of
.BR \-f ,
and
.B \-\-output\-file
is the equivalent of
.BR \-o .
.LP
If
.B optstring
starts with "\c
.B ()\c
",
.B getopts
supports long options with a single dash.
Long options with a single dash have been introduced with
.B Multics
and appeared on
.B UNIX
around 1980, see e.g.
.BR kill (1).
.LP
If a long name argument follows a single dash and cannot be identified as
a long option, it is retried as a combination of single character
letters.
To suppress error messages, the optional initial colon in
.B optstring
must precede the "\c
.B ()\c
":
.LP
  getopts ":()f:(file)(input-file)o:(output-file)"
.LP
In the above example,
.BR \-file ,
.BR \-\-file ,
.BR \-input\-file ,
.B \-\-input\-file
are the equivalent of
.BR \-f ,
and
.B \-output\-file
and
.B \-\-output\-file
is the equivalent of
.BR \-o .
Error messages from
.B getopts
are suppressed and a colon is placed in
.I name
when an option argument for an option like
.B \-f
is missing.
.LP
.B getopts
also supports one or more long options with no related short option.
You must set up a decimal numerical value >= 256 between two question mark
signs in place of an option letter in
.IR optstring :
.LP
  getopts "f:(file)(input-file)?900?:(output-file)"
.LP
In the above example, the long option
.B \-\-output\-file
is associated to the integer value
.B 900
and in case the option
.B \-\-output\-file
was specified, string
.B 900
is set up as the value for

.BI aliasowner= name
Set an alternate trusted owner for the files
.B $HOME/.globals
and
.BR .locals .
By default, the shell ignores alias files if they are not
owned by the current shell user. This option allows one to set up
an alternate file owner that is accepted. Setting the alternate
owner to the empty string disables the feature.
.TP
.B bgnice
All background jobs are run at a lower priority.
This is the default in interactive mode.

that allows one to have a pipe output
file descriptor number in front of the pipe sign
.RB ( | ),
e.g.
.B 2|
for a pipe from
.BR stderr .
It is recommended to put
.RB ` "set\ \-o\ fdpipe" '
into the file
.B $HOME/.shrc
to enable the extended pipe syntax for interactive shells by default.
Scripts that like to use this feature, need to enable it.
.TP
.B fullexitcode
Do not mask the exit code with 0xFF when expanding 
.BR $? .
This gives access to the full 32 bits from the child's exit code via
.B $?
on all modern operating systems that support
.BR waitid (2).
Setting
.B fullexitcode
is needed to evaluate
.IB exitcode " mod 256 == 0"
in conditional expressions as non-zero exit code.
.TP
.B globalaliases
Enables/disables persistent global aliases that are read from the file
.BR $HOME/.globals .
Changing the state for this option first removes all current global aliases.
If the new state is

The POSIX variant of telling the shell not to exit on EOF;
the command
.B exit
must be used instead.
The original method of the history editor introduced in 1984
is to set

When in 
.B POSIX
mode, it is disallowed to use
.RB `` ^ ''
as the pipe symbol, support for
.B test \-t
without a parameter is switched off and the default for directory
operations is set to
.BR \-L .
If this option is enabled at startup or later, all shell variables from the
imported environment are given the
.B export
property.
If this option is switched off, the
.B export
property is switched off
for all imported variables that have not yet been modified.

.B promptcmdsubst
Apply 
.B command substitution
and
.B arithmetic substitution
to the variables
.BR PS1 ,
.BR PS2
and
.BR PS4 .
By default,
.B promptcmdsubst
is switched off to avoid security problems caused by imported variables.
If
.B promptcmdsubst
is switched on, the variables
.BR PS1 ,
.BR PS2
and
.B PS4
are reset to their default values for security reasons.
Note that POSIX only requires parameter substitution, but no
command substitution or arithmetic substitution for

.SS "Command History Editing"
.LP
If compiled with
.BR \-DINTERACTIVE ,
the
.B Bourne Shell
includes a command line history and a command line editor.
.LP
The behavior of the command line editor was defined with a prototype
implementation in 1982 and has unique characteristics compared to other
implementations. The basic editing functions have been inspired by the
behavior of the editor
.BR ved (1).
The command history editor in the Bourne Shell
is using the same code that was introduced in 1984 with
.BR bsh (1).
.LP
The history is implemented as limited
.BR "ring buffer" .
The
.B last recently used
command line is always moved from it's previous
position in the history list to the most recent entry.
The size of the ring buffer is in
.BR HISTORY .
If
.B HISTORY
is unset or set to 
.BR 0 ,
the current command line history is lost and
command line editing is only supported on the current line and
this line is not kept in the history.
Command line editing may be turned off completely by issuing the command
.RB ` "set +o ved" '.
The existing history is not affected by turning off the command line editor.
.LP
Command lines from the existing history may be retrieved with the cursor keys
.RB ( "Cursor up " and " Cursor down" ).
Typing
.B <CR>
or
.B <LF>
executes the command on the line with the cursor.
.LP
Each new command is appended to the end of the history.
If the maximum size of the history is reached, the oldest command is removed.
Identical commands are avoided as far as possible.
If an command is entered that is already in the history, it is moved to the
end of the history.
.SS "History Editing Commands"
.LP
The following line editing commands are supported:
.TP 10
.B ^A
Move the cursor to the beginning of the current command line.
.TP
.B ^C
Interrupt command line reading and parsing.
The current command line is discarded and the next
prompt is displayed. This helps to escape from the parser when it is in
an unknown state.
.TP
.B ^D
Erase the character under the cursor
and then move the cursor to the next character.
.TP
.B DEL
Erase one character to the left of the cursor.
.TP
.B ^E
Move the cursor to the end of the current command line.
.TP
.B ^F
Move cursor one character to the right.
.TP
.B ^H
Move cursor one character to the left.
.sp
.B Warning:
On terminals that offer a large backspace key for deleting characters,
.B ^H
does not work directly as it is mapped to
.BR DEL .
Use the
.B Cursor left
key instead in such a case.
.TP
.B ^N
Move cursor to the next history line.
See below for history navigation.
.TP
.B ^P
Move cursor to the previous history line.
See below for history navigation.
.TP
.B ^U
Erase the whole line.
.TP
.B ^V

the command line without special meaning.
.TP
.B ^^
Get next character, convert it into a control character and insert it into
the command line.
.TP
.B CR
Finish current line and execute it.
.TP
.B NL
Finish current line and execute it.
.TP
.B TAB
Do file name completion for the word to the left side of the cursor.
If more than one file matches the current partial filename, a
.B BEEP
is generated.
Typing a second
.B TAB
displays a list of matching names.
.TP
.B ESC- ^D
Erase the word to the right starting with the character under the cursor.
.TP
.B ESC- DEL
Erase the word to the left of the cursor.
.TP
.B ESC- ^F
Move cursor one word to the right.
.TP
.B ESC- ^H
Move cursor one word to the left.
.LP
The following commands are available to navigate within the history:
.TP 10
.B ^N
Move cursor to the next history line.
When the cursor has been on the last line of the history, move the cursor
to the first line of the history.
.TP
.B ^P
Move cursor to the previous history line.
When the cursor has been on the first line of the history, move the cursor
to the last line of the history.
.TP
.B ESC- ^N
Search forwards in the history.
The user is prompted for a search pattern.
The previous search string is kept and may be edited.
To enter a new search string, first type
.BR ^U .
.TP
.B ESC- ^P
Search backwards in the history.
The user is prompted for a search pattern.
The previous search string is kept and may be edited.
To enter a new search string, first type
.BR ^U .
.TP
.B ESC- p
Search backwards in the history.
Clear the old search pattern first.
.TP
.B ESC- n
Search forwards in the history.
Clear the old search pattern first.
.TP
.B ESC- CR
Return to the history line that was in use before the last search command.
.LP
Other characters are inserted into the command line text.
Characters that are listed above as being edit command characters need to be
quoted using the quote character
.BR ^^ .
If a line is entered via
.B CR
or
.BR NL ,
the current position of the cursor is irrelevant.
.LP
The command line editor remembers the cursor position for each command line
in the history during the lifetime of the shell process.
.SS "History Editing Input Mappings"
.LP
The command line history editor maps input from the terminal into mapped text
before it is interpreted by the editor. If a match is found on the input
from the terminal, the related input text is directly replaced by it's
replacement string.
A mapping may be prevented by typing the map quote character which is the
.B nul
character
.RB ( ^@ ),
directly before the matching text is entered.
If this text is usually interpreted by the history editor, you first need to
type the history editing quoting character
.BR ^^ .
To be sure that you are able to literally enter some text, type
.BR ^^^@
.RB ( "control up-arrow" " followed by " "Nul" " and the text)."

.LP
At startup (directly before the first shell command prompt is shown),
the command line history editor first tries to initialize the
terminal setup using the variables
.BR HOME ,
.BR TERM ,
.B TERMCAP
and
.BR TERMPATH .
.LP
If
.B TERM
is not set, the mapper establishes standard mappings for the cursor keys
assuming an ANSI-compatible terminal.
.LP
.B TERM
is set, the mapper establishes mappings for the following
.B termcap
capabilities:
.TP
.PD
.B ku
.BR "Key cursor up" ,

Note that the

is the larger key that is just above the
.BR "Carriage Return Key" .
In former times, this key was called
.B Delete
and send the 
.BR \e177 " (" DEL )
character.
Since companies followed the design of the IBM PC keyboard layout,
the related key usually sends
.BR \e010 .
If you like to literally enter a backspace into the command line, type
.BR ^^^@^H
.RB ( "control up-arrow" " followed by " "Nul"
.RB "followed by " ^H ).
.PD

.LP
After the mappings from the
.B termcap
entry for the current terminal type
have been established, the shell tries to read the file
.B $HOME/.bshmap
to retrieve additional mappings.
.LP
Each line in the file
.B $HOME/.bshmap
has the following structure:
.LP
.IB "  map_from" : map_to : comment
.LP
.TP 10
.I map_from
is the string that is going to be replaced in the input.
.TP
.I map_to
is the string replacement.
.TP
.I comment
is optional comment that is not used for mapping itself.
.LP
If both
.I map_from
and
.I map_to
are empty, the related line is ignored by the mapper, so a line may contain:
.LP
.BI "  ::" comment
.LP
A
.B nul character
in either
.I map_from
or
.I map_to
is currently not supported, but an empty
.I map_to
is interpreted as a 
.BR "nul character" .
.LP
If a line has an empty
.I map_to
and the comment field starts with a 
.B *
like this:
.LP
.IB "  map_from" :: *comment
.LP
an existing mapping is removed. This permits to avoid unwanted mappings
that have been set up from the
.B TERMCAP
entry.
A typical use case for this feature is to avoid the mapping:
.LP
.BR "  ^H" : "^?" : "Key Backspace -> Delete Char"
.LP
that is caused by the
.B TERMCAP
capability
.B kb
for terminals that create a backspace with the delete key.
.LP
Since the file
.B $HOME/.bshmap
is read in a sequential way, a later line with the same
.I map_from
may establish a different mapping.
.LP
The maximum length of
.I map_from
is 16 bytes,
the maximum length of
.I map_to
is 128 bytes.
The maximum total line length is 8192 bytes.
Each entry takes exactly one line in the file.
.LP
Control characters may be written using the same escape sequences as permitted
with
.BR TERMCAP .
.LP
The builtin
.B map
command may be used to enter additional maps at runtime.
.LP
As the
.B nul character
is the quote character of the mapper, enter two
.B nul characters
to get one
.B nul character
in the edit input.
To enter a mapped string (such as cursor key output), first enter the
quote character of the command line history editor control ^
.RB ( ^^ ") octal 036,"
then enter a
.B nul character
and finally the otherwise mapped text.

.SS Termcap
.LP
The
.B termcap
data base is used to make the command history editor independent
from the terminal capabilities. Cursor key output is retrieved from
the data base and mapped to the cursor movement commands of the
history editor.

.BR termcap:
.TP 10
.B HOME
To find the private files like
.BR $HOME/.termcap .
.TP
.B TERM
A name representing the type of the current terminal.
.TP
.B
TERMCAP
This environment variable holds either a precompiled
.B termcap

.B sh
and
.B jsh
when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2^31 bytes).
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
Errors detected by the shell, such as syntax errors, cause the shell to
return a non-zero exit status. If the shell is being used non-interactively
execution of the shell file is abandoned. Otherwise, the shell returns the
exit status of the last command executed (see also the
.B exit
command above).
.SS "jsh Only"
.sp
.LP
If the shell is invoked as
.B jsh
and an attempt is made to exit the
shell while there are stopped jobs, the shell issues one warning:
.sp
.LP
.B There are stopped jobs.
.sp
.LP
This is the only message. If another exit attempt is made, and there are
still stopped jobs they are sent a

signal from the kernel and
the shell is exited.

.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
The use of
.B setuid
shell scripts is
.B strongly
discouraged.
.SH NOTES
.LP
For compatibility with the
.BR "Thompson shell" ,
.B ^
is a synonym for
.B |
as pipeline separator.
Do not use in new scripts.
.LP
Words used for filenames in input/output redirection are not interpreted
for filename generation (see
.B File Name Generation
section above). For example,
.B cat file1 >a*
creates a file named
.BR a* .
.LP
The built-in command
.BI . " file"
reads the whole file before any commands are executed.
When a command substitution, a set of commands from
.BR eval ,
.BR dosh ,
.BR repeat ,
.BR command ,
.BR fc ,
.BR jobs
or
.B trap
are parsed, the whole set of command are read at once.
.B alias
and
.B unalias
commands in the file do not apply to any commands defined in the file
or inside a set of commands executed with the named built-ins.
.sp
.LP
Because commands in pipelines are run as separate processes, variables set
in a pipeline have no effect on the parent shell.
.sp
.LP
If you get the error message
.BR "'cannot fork, too many processes'" ,
try using the
.BR wait (1)
command to clean up your background processes. If
this doesn't help, the system process table is probably full or you have too
many active foreground processes. There is a limit to the number of process
ids associated with your login, and to the number the system can keep track
of.
.sp
.LP
Only the last process in a pipeline can be waited for.
.sp
.LP
If a command is executed, and a command with the same name is installed in
a directory in the search path before the directory where the original
command was found, the shell continues to
.B exec
the original command.
Use the
.B hash\ \-r
command to correct this situation.
.sp
.LP
The Bourne shell has a limitation on the effective
.B UID
for a process.
If this
.B UID
is less than 100 (and not equal to the real UID of the
process), then the
.B UID
is reset to the real UID of the process.
.sp
.LP
If not in
.B job control
mode, the shell implements both foreground and background jobs in the same
process group and they all receive the same signals, which can
lead to unexpected behavior. It is, therefore, recommended to switch on
.B job control
mode via
.B set \-m
in an interactive environment.
.LP
Parameter assignments that precede a special builtin command
affect the shell itself.
Parameter assignments that precede the call of a function are ignored.
.LP
When the shell executes a shell script that attempts to execute a
non-existent command interpreter, the shell returns an erroneous diagnostic
message that the shell script file does not exist.
.LP
If your platform does not provide an
.B /etc/termcap
file, or if your termcap database does not contain an entry for the terminal
type you are using, the following command may be used to convert a terminfo
entry into a termcap entry and to append it to your private termcap database

.SH COMPATIBILITY
This Bourne Shell started with the source state from OpenSolaris
build 51 from October 2006.
It was later changed to the equivalent state of build 144 from July 2010.
The changes up to build 147 have not been applied because these 
later versions from Sun reduced the functionality.
.LP
Most changes fixed bugs or added functionality without changing the expected
previous behavior.
.LP
The following incompatible changes have been introduced in order to follow the
.B POSIX
standard.
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B number parameters
This version of the Bourne Shell is more picky when parsing numbers.
Previous versions of the shell did accept e.g.
.B 0x12
for the number
.B 0
as parsing just stopped at the first non digit.
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B parameter assignment
This version of the Bourne Shell fixed the order of evaluation for
parameter assignments to be left to right instead of right to left (as
implemented in previous versions). This may cause scripts to fail if they
expect the old non-standard behavior.
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B parameter assignment preceding builtin commands
With this version of the Bourne Shell, parameter assignment preceding
builtin commands only affects the shell itself if this is related to a
.BR "special builtin command" . 
In previous versions, this affected the shell itself for any builtin command.
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B parameter import from the environment
When the shell is on POSIX mode, it sets the
.B export
property on all shell variables imported from the environment.
This makes all changes in these variables automatically visible to
the next child process. The historic behavior is to pass the imported
values to the child's environment but to use a separate storage location
for the internal shell variable until the
.B export
builtin is explicitly called for a specific variable.
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B syntax errors in builtin commands
With this version of the Bourne Shell, only special builtin commands may
terminate the whole shell in case that shell is not an interactive shell.
In previous versions, all builtin commands could terminate a non-interactive
shell if a utility syntax error or a fatal utility error was encountered.
.sp
The most prominent result of this change is that the builtin
.B cd
command no longer terminates a shell script in case that the
.B cd
command did not work for whatever reason. So be careful and always check the
exit code in shell scripts.
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B expanding here documents
With this version of the Bourne Shell, the quoting state is reset before
a here document is expanded and restored thereafter. This avoids that
.sp
.in +2
.nf
var=you
echo "`cat <<EOF
Hi $var
EOF`"
.fi
.in -2
.sp
prints
.RB `` "Hi \ey\eo\eu" ''
as done by the historical Bourne Shell,
instead of the expected
.RB `` "Hi you" ''.
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B case
When in 
.B POSIX
mode,
.B sh
no longer implements a fallback to a simple string compare,
in case that an attempt to match the pattern similar to
.BR fnmatch (3)
fails.
.sp
This makes it behave different than the
.B Korn Shell
reference implementation but the undocumented behavior kept from old
.B Bourne Shell
versions may cause unexpected matches, like a match to the string
.B [0-9]
even though a match to decimal digits only was intended.
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B cd
POSIX introduced new options
.B \-L
and
.B \-P
and defaults to logical mode while the historic Bourne Shell did implement
a physical mode that operates on normalized directory names.
.sp
In logical mode, the command argument
.B ../*
may refer to different files than calling
.B cd ..
followed by a command with the argument
.BR *.
In logical and physical mode, the command argument
.B *
may refer to different files than calling
.BI cd "\ somedir"
followed by a command with the argument
.BR ../* .
.sp
While the latter problem is caused by the existence of a
.B symlink
in the new path, the first problem is caused by the behavior of
.BR "cd\ \-L" .
This is why the Bourne Shell, when not in POSIX mode
.RB ( "set\ \-o\ posix" " not set),"
did not change it's default
behavior and assumes
.B "cd\ \-P"
when neither
.B \-L
nor
.B \-P
have been specified.
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B continue
With SVr2 (1986), a parameter was introduced for
.BR continue .
Unfortunately, at the same time a bug was introduced and a big number did not
.B continue
the outermost loop, but rather did
.B break
the outermost loop.
This shell fixes this bug.
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B functions
There is now a separate name space for functions and shell variables.
This is not expected to cause problems.
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B getopts
POSIX requires
.B getopts
to set
.B OPTARG
to the failing option character in case that
.B optstring
starts with a
.BR : .
Previous versions of the shell did unset
.B OPTARG
in case of a failure.
POSIX also requires the shell variable related to the
.I name
argument from
.B getopts
to be set to
.RB `` ? ''
when
.B getopts
returns a non-zero exit code.
Previous versions of the shell did set
.I name
to the null string in this case.
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B kill
The option parsing of the
.B kill
command was modified to be compatible to the POSIX standard.
This is not expected to cause problems as the change only affects
marginal cases with negative process id's that caused problems before as well.
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B read
.br
The field splitting required by the POSIX standard does not skip multiple
.I non-space
field separators but rather assigns empty values to variables in such a case.
This is a significant change in the behavior, but the historic behavior is not
useful for
.I non-space
field separators as this would not allow e.g. reading the password file via
.BR read (1).
.ne 4
.TP
.B return
In the original Bourne Shell, the
.B return
command only returns from inside a function.
This version of the shell implements return also from inside a
.B dot
script as required by POSIX.
.sp
This change causes an incompatibility in case that a
.B dot
script is read from inside a function and the script is intended to return from
the function.
.ne 4
.TP
.BR retval " and " "Command Substitution"
This version of the shell no longer uses a command substitution as a
checkpoint where the
.B exitcode
is remembered for
.BR $? .
This affects calls to
.B exit
and
.B return
without parameter.
If such a call did not happen after a regular command, but e.g.
after a parameter assignment with a command substitution, the
implicit return/exit code was the exit code of the last command
substitution and now is the exit code of the last regular command.
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.BR pipes " and " words
.br
When in POSIX mode, the
.RB `` ^ ''
character is not accepted as an alternate pipe
.RB `` | ''
symbol.
This results in different word delimiting rules, words that contain
.RB `` ^ ''
do not need to be quoted.
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B set
.br
The output of the
.B set
command with no arguments was modified to include the quoting
required by the POSIX standard.
This is not expected to cause problems but the new output may be used as shell.
.sp
When in full POSIX mode
.RB "(via " "set\ \-o\ posix" ),
functions are not listed amongst shell variables.
This is expected to cause problems as POSIX does not include a method to
list shell functions.
.sp
Calling
.RB `` "set \-\-" ''
now causes the positional parameters to be unset. Previous versions of the shell
left the positional parameters untouched in this case.
A portable method to clear the positional parameters is to call
.RB `` "shift $#" ''.
.ne 4
.TP
.BR "set \-e" " and " "Command Substitution"
The historic Bourne Shell did abort the first
.B echo
command in the following example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
.B
sh -c '(set -e; echo ERR `false`; echo ERR); echo OK'
.fi
.in -2
.sp
and printed only a single line with:
.BR OK .
.sp
POSIX requires to treat
.B `false`
as a sub shell, to let the main shell ignore the exit code from
the command substitution and let it only use the exit code from the
.B echo
command. This requires to print:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
.B ERR
.B ERR
.B OK
.fi
.in -2
.sp
.ne 4
.TP
.B test
The behavior of the builtin
.B test
utility was changed by POSIX.
POSIX requires
.B test
to select it's behavior from the number of arguments in case that the number
of arguments is in the range from 0..4.
This results e.g. in
.RB `` "test\ \-r" ''
to return a zero exit code because
.RB `` \-r ''
is a non-empty string, while previous versions of the shell did return
an error because
.RB `` \-r ''
is an unary operator that misses an argument.
Correctly written scripts do not suffer from this change.
.sp
When not in POSIX mode
.RB ( "set\ \-o\ posix" " not set),"
.B test
still understands
.B test \-t
without a parameter for compatibility with UNIX scripts.
.ne 4
.TP
.B times
The output of the
.B times
command was modified to be compatible to the POSIX standard.
This is not expected to cause problems.
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B trap
The output of the
.B trap
command was modified to be compatible to the POSIX standard.
Scripts that depend on the output of the trap command,
when listing existing trap state,
should be converted to be portable by
checking whether the output starts with
.B trap --
and then use a POSIX compliant parser.
.LP
The following other incompatible changes have been introduced:
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B pipes
While in the original Bourne Shell none of the commands from a pipeline
command was a child of the original shell, this version of the Bourne Shell
tries to make all simple commands in a pipeline children from the original
shell.
In addition, if a builtin command is the rightmost command of a pipeline,
it will now be run in the original shell.
This permits commands like:
.sp
.BI " echo foo | read " var
.sp
to set the variable
.I var
in the main shell.
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B I/O redirection on compound commands
With the original Bourne Shell, I/O redirection on compound commands
cause the compound commands to be run in a subshell and variable
assignment inside such constructs not to affect the main shell.
This version of the shell tries to avoid to run compound commands
with I/O redirection in a subshell. Variable assignment thus works
as expected.
.sp
If the input or the output of a
.B while
or
.B until
loop was
redirected in the original Bourne Shell,
the commands in the loop have been run in a sub-shell, and variables
set or changed there had no effect on the parent process:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
   lastline=
   while read line
   do

           lastline=$line
   done < /etc/passwd
   echo "lastline=$lastline"       # lastline is empty!
.fi
.in -2
.sp
.sp
In these cases, the input or output could be redirected by using
.BR exec ,
as in the following example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
   # Save standard input (file descriptor 0) as file
   # descriptor 3, and redirect standard input from the file
   /etc/passwd:

   exec 3<&0               # save standard input as fd 3
   exec </etc/passwd       # redirect input from file

   lastline=

This version of the shell works with both variants.
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B time
The
.B time
token is now a reserved word. This permits to time pipelines as a whole
but may cause problems when people assume that it is a command.
When in doubt, call
.B
"time\ \-p"
instead as the fact that the next word is an option disables the
.B time
token to be recognized as a reserved word.
