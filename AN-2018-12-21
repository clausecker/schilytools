New features with AN-2018-12-21:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. If your smake is too old and aborts, ensure this
	*** by calling:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4
	The recent smake version is smake-1.3

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-01-26 introduced
	*** optimizations for the Schily version of SunPro Make, you
	*** need at least the dmake version from 2018/01/11 with support
	*** for the "export" directive to compile with this makefile system.


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

-	include/schily/stdint.h & include/schily/utypes.h: added a workarounf for a
	Solaris _CHAR_IS_SIGNED / _CHAR_IS_UNSIGNED Bug

-	Bourne Shell: make it exit the whole shell with set -e after a command
		substitution failed on the right side of a variable assignment
		that has no command. This is required by POSIX.

-	Bourne Shell: added a unit tests for the above case.

-	Bourne Shell: New version date set to 2018-12-08 the this change.

-	sdd: added a new message in retry mode. Sdd now prints the offset of a
	failed big read before retrying to read it in 512 byte block size.
	This helps to see where a disk has problems that always fails with
	big reads but never fails with the retries.

-	sdd: added a new option seczize= that allows to specify a sector 
	size != 512 bytes and makes sdd ready for recovering disks with larger
	sector sizes.

-	SCCS the prs man page now tries to make the table less wide.

-	SCCS: libcomobj::bulkprepare() the current working directory inside the
	project home directory tree now gets an appendet "/" before "SCCS" is
	appended.

-	SCCS: sccs: now has better comment in the function makefile() that 
	usually prepends simple file names by "SCCS/s." before passing them
	to the low level programs. This is the main place where future versions
	of sccs.c need to be modified to be able to use the new -N option
	from the low level programs. The -N option however is needed for
	"off tree" repositories.

-	SCCS: sccs now checks for SCCS/s. in the function makefile(). This
	results in attempts to check for SCCS/SCCS/s.x.file, but previous
	versions complained: "SCCS/x.file not an SCCS file" which is not
	better. In order to prepare the future use of -NSCCS, the new method
	is needed.

-	SCCS: sccs now has a new variable "NewMode" that is set if the directory
	".sccs" is seen in the project set home directory. This is the upcomming
	switch between the old mode where "sccs" translates g-file names into
	s.file names before calling the SCCS low level programs and the new mode
	where g-files + the option -NSCCS are used as argument for the low level
	SCCS prrograms.

	This can be controlled via the environment "SCCS_NMODE". If present and
	set to "FALSE", "NewMode" is disabled regardless of the presence of
	".sccs" and otherwise "NewMode" is enabled regardless of the presence of
	".sccs".

	WARNING: currently you need to set the environment SCCS_NMODE=TRUE to
	enable this test mode since there is a need to change a lot in the code
	to make it work again this way.

-	SCCS: sccs: Now using strdup() instead of malloc(strlen(buf) + 1) + strcpy()

-	SCCS: sccs now has a new subcommand "root" that prints the project
	set home directory in case it has been initialized via "sccs init".

-	SCCS: libcomobj: the get(1) implementation from admin(1) has been
	moved to libcomobj::doget()

-	SCCS: libcomojb::doget() now calls sclose() and sfree().

-	SCCS: libcomojb::parseN() now recognizes a space character as a
	placeholder for a flag that is ignored. This allows to make sccs.c
	simpler as it is now able to modify the behavor of called low level
	programs, e.g. to use "-N SCCS" to get a vanilla delta(1) or to use
	"-N+SCCS" to get the behavior of "sccs delget".

-	SCCS: delta now supports new options -k and -N+... This permits
	do do a "delget" operation with only using delta(1).

-	SCCS: a test for the new implicit get(1) in dalta(1) with -N+SCCS
	has been added.

-	SCCS: sccsdiff shell script is now able to deal with a -N option that
	contains space characters. This needs the use of IFS= and $Nflag as 
	"$Nflag" would otherwise result in an unwanted empty argument.

-	SCCS: all programs: added some more gettext() calls e.g. for the 
	-version option.

-	SCCS: sccslog: added support for setlocale()/gettext()

-	SCCS: sccsfile man page now contains an overview of all files used by
	all SCCS commands.

-	SCCS: man pages now contain a hint on where to download the sourcecode.

-	SCCS: sccslog man page fixed a bug with a typo that used .PD 0 instead of
	just .PD

-	SCCS: The version has been bumped to 5.09 with date 2018/12/18. 



-	SCCS TODO:

	-	Convert sccs.c to use -NSCCS in the back end programs instead
		of converting g-file names from the command line into s.file
		names in the frontend in order to forward s.file names to the
		backend programs. Doing it this way allows us to have the SCCS
		history files "off tree" in a separate directory tree starting
		with ".sccs/" at the "project root" directory, as the related
		code to convert path names is in libcomobj::bulkprepare().

	-	Add code to admin(1) and delta(1) to retrieve the list of
		new or modified files in order to have all important code
		for a "sccs commit" in a single program that does not need to
		deal with ARG_MAX limitations.

	-	Add code to admin(1), delta(1) and get(1) to maintain/understand
		the changeset file.

	-	Add code to libcomobj to understand the changeset file,
		which is needed in order to e.g. know the file names and file
		specific SIDs/state that correspond to a project global SID.

	-	Add code to all programs to maintain a lock (for the file
		$PROJECTHOME/.sccs/SCCS/s.changeset, that would be in the file
		$PROJECTHOME/.sccs/SCCS/z.changeset) to maintain a project
		global lock.

	-	Find/verify a complete transactional model that allows to repair
		complex changes to the set of files for a project that have
		been aborted in the middle. The current idea is to create the
		file $PROJECTHOME/.sccs/changeset with the deltas to the
		changeset during a complex update operation.

	-	Find a way to decide when to use SCCS v6 type history files.
		For the project mode, this is needed in order to prevent 
		historic SCCS implementations to believe they could modify
		files without knowing about project global locks.





-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.

-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
