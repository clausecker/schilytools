New features with AN-2015-09-03:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	Bourne Shell: Support for set -o bgnice was aded

-	Bourne Shell: Support for set -o ignoreeof was added

-	Bourne Shell: Support for set -b / set -o notify was added.
	There is currenly no related function in the shell.

-	Bourne Shell: Support for export -p name=value and readonly -p name=value
	was added, making this interface POSIX compliant.

-	Bourne Shell: Fixed a job control problem we introduced with reordering
	code in jobs.c. (exec ps) will no longer cause the shell to die on SIGTTIN.

-	Bourne Shell: Added a workaround for Linux for the above SIGTTIN problem
	that exists because Linux comed with an incomplete waitid() implementation
	where WNOWAIT is not supported.

-	Bourne Shell: the output from set -o is now sorted.

-	Bourne Shell: unset(1) now supports the POSIX options -f and -v.

-	Bourne Shell: getopts(1) now supports long-only options (long options
	with no related short option). To set up a long-only option, replace the
	short option letter by "?ddd?", where ddd is a decimal number that should
	be >= 256. if you call:

		getopts "?9000?(long)" XOPT

	in a script and the script is called with "--long" as an argument, then
	getopts places the value "9000" in the shell variable "XOPT".

-	Bourne Shell: some code that should have been #ifdef'd is now in proper
	#ifdef statements to help to reduce the size of "osh".

-	"osh": We no longer use the waitid() emulation if the platform comes
	with a working waitid() implementation. This helps to reduce the
	size of osh.

-	bsh / Bourne Shell: a Typo in abbrev.c was fixed and the Bourne Shell is
	now able to link without libschily in case the platform supports snprintf().

-	bsh / Bourne Shell (libshedit): The method to store multi line commands
	such as:

		if true
		then
			echo ok
		fi

	was modified to work with bsh and Bourne Shell. Now the ANSI-NL character
	is only used in the history file; the history editor uses a \n displayed
	as ^J as the "line end" character between the lines from the previous
	command.

-	libgetopt now supports long only options. See getopts(1) above for more
	information.

-	libshedit: New interface function shedit_igneof() to set up a function
	pointer that returns != 0 in case the shell was set up with
	"set -o ignoreeof"

-	Bourne Shell: The builtin commands no longer use getopt() but the new
	optget() that maintains state and thus makes the implementation more 
	readable than with the previous code that has the state management code
	visible in every builtin command.

-	bsh libshedit (Bourne Shell): a bug in inputc.c was fixed that could
	cause a coredump if a command line was longer than 512 chars. This was
	because of a typo the numbe of bytes was used for the available
	length nstead of the number of wchar_t entries in an array.


-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not excute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
