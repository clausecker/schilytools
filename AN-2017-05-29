New features with AN-2017-05-29:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	autoconf/config.sub now groks ppc64 on Linux.

-	autoconf: new tests for ar.h and rpc/rpc.h

-	autoconf: new test for semaphore.h

-	RULES/*haiku-*.rul The rules for shared libraries now work

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	RULES/cc-*.rul: added a LIB_C=-lc to prepare compilation on Haiku

-	RULES/bepc-haiku-cc.rul and RULES/bepc-haiku-gcc.rul: Added LIB_C=
	to clean the name of libc on Haiku that does not have libc.
	We need to link all shared libraries against -lc in case they use
	system interfaces but are not allowed to do the same on Haiku.

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	libshedit/mystdio.h got a new #undef EOF to make compilation
	on Haiku quiet.

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	bsh sys.c & Bourne Shell jobs.c : Do not rely on more than the
	time values in struct rusage when on Haiku

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	SunPro Make: fixed a typo in a comment in main.cc

	Thanks to a report from Robert Clausecker

-	SunPro Make: let libmksh/dosys.cc use schily/wait.h to deal with
	the missing macro WCOREDUMP() on Haiku

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	SunPro Make: make::ar.cc no longer includes ar.h in case it does
	not exist (e.g. on Haiku). The include file ar.h is not needed
	as all needed definitions are already in ar.cc

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	SunPro Make: make::pmake.cc no longer includes rpc/rpc.h in case it
	does not exist (e.g. on Haiku). The include file is not needed in case
	that host2netname() is not used.

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	SunPro Make: make::parallel.cc no longer includes sys/shm.h in case
	it does not exist (e.h. on Haiku). We now may use mmap() instead
	of shmat() in case that shmat() is not available.

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	SunPro Make: make::pmake.cc now includes <schily/hostname.h> to get
	a getdomainname() prototype.

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	SunPro Make: Make/include/mk/defs.h now calls #undef MAX to avoid a warning
	on Haiku

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	SunPro Make: libmakestate::lock.c and libvroot::lock.cc no longer #include
	sys/errno.h. They already include errno.h which is POSIX and sys/errno.h
	is missing on Haiku

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	SunPro Make: libmakestate::Makefile now uses $(LIB_C) to avoid
	linking against -lc on Haiku but allow it on any other OS.

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	SunPro Make: libvroot::mount.cc no longer includes sys/mount.h in case
	it does not exist (e.g. on Haiku). The include file is not needed.
	Fortunately, libvroot::mount.cc is nit needed in case make is not
	compiled with NSE support.

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	SunPro Make: The man pages now document several previously
	undocumented environment variables. This is e.g.:

	-	Document that DMAKE_ADJUST_MAX_JOBS supports the
		value "M2" to create a global job counter that is
		shared between all recursive make instances.

	-	Mention that USE_SVID is an alias for USE_SVR4_MAKE.

	-	Nention SUN_MAKE_COMPAT_MODE and that the value GNU
		modifies the behavior fpr expansion of $< and $*.

	-	Mention TMPDIR

-	SunPro Make now should work on Haiku

-	SCCS: fixed a missing semicolon in libcassi/fatal.c that was
	active when not compiling inside the Schily Makefilesystem.

-	SCCS: removed the "help2" program and put the content from
	help2.c into the program help.c

-	SCCS: the delta program now uses the same search strategy for "bdiff"
	as already used for "diff".

-	SCCS: several source files removed a superfluous semicolon after
	a "#pragma ident" statement.

-	SCCS: sccs/README.SCCS no longer mentions "help2" that has been
	removed.

-	SCCS: "sccs -R log SCCS" now gives useful output.

-	SCCS: "sccs log ...." now silently skips files that do not start
	with "^Ah"

-	OCSW/CSWsccs: removed the help2 binary

-	Bourne Shell: Fixed a bug in the default PATH that is used when
	PATH is unset: The algorithm needs the string "::" to mark the
	current direcgtory as part of the search path. The algorithm
	adds a second ":" to a PATH parameter that ends in ":", but it
	does not for the built in default path search strings.

-	Bourne Shell: Variables imported from the environment are now
	(when initially in POSIX mode) automatically given the "export"
	property and thus cannot be modified separately internally from
	the exported environment.

	Thanks to Stephane Chazelas for reporting

-	Bourne Shell: Multiple non-space IFS characters now cause
	empty words in the argument list as POSIX requires. Multiple
	space IFS characters are still skipped as before.

	Thanks to Stephane Chazelas for reporting

-	Bourne Shell: New conformance tests check whether multiple
	non-space IFS characters create empty words.

-	Bourne Shell: post-command IO redirection directives on
	if/then/elif constructs no longer apply only to the elif
	part but to the whole command.

		lastline=
		while read line
		do
			lastline=$line
		done < /etc/passwd
		echo "lastline=$lastline"

	now prints the last line of /etc/passwd without the exec "trick"
	that is documented in the man page.

-	Bourne Shell: added a new conformance test to check whether
	the IO redirection on if/then/elif constructs works correctly.

-	Bourne Shell: IO redirection on compound commands no longer
	cause them to be executed in a sub-shell. This causes:

		A=1; { A=2; } < /dev/null; echo $A

	to print "2" instead of "1" as done by a historic Bourne Shell.

-	Bourne Shell: Fixed a bug with "local" that caused a previous
	undefined variable to keep the local value from the function
	instead of being reset to the undefined state after the function
	did end.

-	Bourne Shell: The shell compiles again when INTERACTIVE is
	not #defined but DO_SYSFC is #defined

-	Bourne Shell: do no longer switch on interactive mode automatically
	unless stdin is connected to a terminal.

-	libshedit: do no longer print prompts unless stdin is connected
	to a terminal.

-	pkgdefs: some of the Svr4 package metadata files have been
	updated to match the current projects.




-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.


-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
