New features with AN-2012-04-19:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	libschily/getperm.c now supports a new flag GP_UMASK in order to
	support "umask +w" in a POSIX correct way.

-	bsh now uses GP_UMASK for the getperm() flag in the builtin
	umask command.

-	Bourne Shell: umask now supports the POSIX "-S" option to print
	the current umask in a symbolic form.

-	Bourne Shell: umask now supports a chmod(1) like symbolic mode
	to set umask. This is fully POSIX compliant, so beware:

	"umask -r", "umask -w", ... are intentionally forbidden.

	Use "umask -- -r", ... instead.

	The output of umask -S is suitable for setting a new umask.

-	Bourne Shell: The builtin read command now supports the
	POSIX option -r to treat read backslash characters non-special.

-	Bourne Shell: Fixed a bug: With set -a, "read VAR" now also
	auto-exports VAR as expected.

-	Bourne Shell: The option -version has been documented.

-	Bourne Shell: The ulimit builtin command now supports the options:
	-l, -m, -u for better compatibility with *BSD and Linux. These
	options have been taken from ksh93.

-	Bourne Shell: The parser has been changed to evaluate variable/macro
	assignments (e.g. var2=val2 var1=val1) from left to right. Previous
	versions did this from right to left, causing "foo=`echo $bar` bar=text"
	to set foo=test even though people might asume that foo is left empty.

	If you have problems with this change, recompile sh with:

		smake COPTX=-DARGS_RIGHT_TO_LEFT

	and report your problem.

-	Bourne Shell: The SVR4.0 colon (null command) redirection bug that
	caused sh only to create xxx.1 with:

		for i in 1 2; do
			: > xxx.$i
		done

	has been fixed.

-	Bourne Shell: The man page now contains a documentation for
	the builtin commands "getopts", "read" and "test".

-	Bourne Shell: The man page now contains a first (still incomplete)
	documentation for the command history editor.

-	Bourne Shell: The FILES section in the man page was rewritten.

-	Bourne Shell: The special variable section in the man page now mentions
	the variables: HISTORY, SAVEHISTORY, IGNOREEOF, TERM, TERMCAP, TERMPATH
	that are used by the history editor.

-	Bourne Shell: The special variable section in the man page now mentions
	the variables: OPTARG and OPTIND

-	Bourne Shell: The automatic variable section in the man page now mentions
	$n ($1 ...), $0, $* and $@
