If you have previously reported bugs to Jörg Schilling and they have not
been fixed, please report them again.  We do not have access to Jörg's
private emails and do not know what you have reported.

NEW FEATURES:

-	RULES: add symlinks for avbarm/riscv/amd64 for NetBSD.
	Submitted by: Matthew Green.

-	Remove the register keyword from C++ sources.  This keyword has
	been removed from the C++ language with C++17 and provides no
	benefit on most toolchains.  Discard the keyword from all C++
	sources to enable a build with the new standard.
	Submitted by: Dennis Clarke.

-	mkisofs: produce less scrollback when logging progress to tty.
	Previously, the "xxx.xx% done, estimated finish ..." message was
	verbosely printed onto a new line each time it appears.  If
	output goes to a TTY and -gui is not supplied, we now print the
	message only once, updating it as the program progresses.
	Reported by: Michael Dexter.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS:

-	Schilytools contains pxupgrade, a dummy for a closed-source
	component.  While the source code of this component is available
	to the maintainer, it cannot be published due to an existing NDA
	with Plextor.  Depending on whether we can get this NDA lifted
	or not, the pxupgrade dummy code may either be replaced with the
	real source code of the tool or removed altogether.

-	With development of the p7zip(1) utility having ceased in 2016
	and the 7-zip project having ported the reference implementation
	to UNIX-like systems, many packagers now ship a 7z(1) command
	instead of p7zip(1).  Future star distributions may ship an
	/etc/default/star file configuring P7ZIP_CMD to refer to 7z(1)
	instead of the default p7zip(1).  This will not affect existing
	installations unless the configuration is updated.

-	Configuring compression/decompression helpers may be implemented
	for DOS (DJGPP) in an upcoming version.
