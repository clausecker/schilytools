New features with AN-2011-04-22:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****


-	Disable Simple suffix rules and Sufffix rules in smake to speedup builds

-	Added a comment in RULES/rules.rdi that this rule is no longer needed.
	Use RULES/rules.dir in all cases.

-	Star adds a new option -lzip and automated support to recognize lzip
	compressed archives.
	Thanks to markk@clara.co.uk

-	star now accepts a command like:

	star -c -onull -find . -ls

	as there is no archive output to stdout that could mix with the -ls
	output

-	libfind no longer exits the process in treewalk() in case that 
	the path strings could not be allocated.

-	libfind::walkclose() now free()s the internal data structures
	in case of a user that does not call treewalk() (e.g.  star -x)

-	Avoid some gcc warnings for patch

-	Avoid some gcc warnings for hdump/od

-	SCCS "val" now supports directory type command line arguments that
	result in scanning the related directory for s. files.

-	SCCS "val" now gives better debug messages with val -T, inclufing line
	numbers for the s. file.

-	SCCS "sccs" now permits -R together with the val subcommand.

-	SCCS "sccs" now correclty deals with lon path names (> 64 chars) when
	in -R mode

-	The diff command (as used by SCCS) now supports the -N option.

-	The sccsfile.4 man page now correclty mentions the ^Ahddddd checksum line.

-	patch(1) no longer calls mkdir(1) but mkdir(2)

-	Some forgotten variables in patch(1) are now off_t for large file compliance.
