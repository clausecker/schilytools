New features with AN-2010-09-22:

-	The macros XARCH_GEN & XARCH_OPT are now in RULES/cc-sunpro*.rul

-	The include file include/schily/ccomdefs.h now allows to disable
	the printf() format checks for GCC with -DNO_PRINTFLIKE
	This is needed in order to allow star to compile in the Solaris ON
	cosolidation as GCC id too dumb for the printf() extensions.

-	libschily/?eterrno.c no longer overwrite the _TS_ERRNO definition
	in order to pass the compile constrints in the Solaris ON consoliation.

-	Several new global symbols in the mapfile for libschily/libschily-mapvers

-	libschily/wcsndup.c had frgotten code and still did internaly implement
	strndup()

-	librmt.so now includes libsocked in the NEEDED ELF tag

-	Typo corrections in mkisofs/mkisofs.8 man page

-	Add a hint to the mkisofs output when files change while mkisofs
	is running.

-	Removed an superfluos #include <schily/stat.h> from mkisofs/disg/isoinfo.c

-	star now supports automatic recognition of xz(1) compressed archives
	and offers a new option -xz

-	star offers new behavior:

	A tar archive created with "star -c -dump -meta ..." does not include
	the content for plain files but only the meta data. With "star -c -xmeta"
	these files could be extracted as 0 by sized files in case that this would
	not overwrite existing files. Star now supports "star -x -xmeta -fore-hole"
	to extract these files as files of the original size but as sparse files
	without any data inside. This is sufficient as a reference for wget -mirror.

-	The man page star/spax.1 fixed a typo.

-	A typo in cdrecord.c was corrected.

-	The chdir builtin in bsh no longer tries to evaluate $CDPATH after
	an attempt to do a chdir "" did result in a ENOENT condition because
	chdir "" is illegal.

-	All include files (even those created by autoconf) are now protected
	against multiple includion.

-	New autoconf test for pathconf() and fpathconf()

-	libscg/scg/aspi-dos.h now uses viod instead of VOID ti allow a compilation
	with gcc.

-	libscg/scsi-wnt.c (MS-WIN) now supports 64 SCSI busses

-	Fixed a typo in cdda2wav/cdda2ogg.1 (man page)

-	Star now supports pax -oa (do not preserve atime with restore)

-	A new program was added: "cpp"
	This cpp implementation is based on the UNIX 32V version from 1978
	with permission from Caldera Inc.
	Note that this is a K&R cpp that is needed for several programs,
	e.g. rpcgen(1) and dtrace(1). The port was done as part of the
	OpenSolaris emancipation project. With this cpp, it is possible
	to replace a non-redistributable cpp from Sun/Oracle.

	Note that the program is installed as /opt/schily/lib/cpp by default.

	This cpp adds the following new features to the cpp from 1978:

	-	Support for #ident, #pragma and #error was added

	-	Support for #elif was added

	-	The length of identifiers was raised from 8 to 128

	-	A new option -T allows to switch back to 8 char identifiers.

	-	The number of supported -U/-D options was enhanced from 20 to 64

	-	The number of supported -I options was enhanced from 8 to 20

	-	The #include nesting level was enhanced from 10 to 16

	-	cpp now looks in "." for #include "file" in case
		the input is read from stdin.

	-	A new -Ysystemdir option was added

	-	A new -undef option was added

	-	A new option -H was added to list the included file names

	-	A bug in the yacc parser for the #if expressions was fixed

	-	cpp now uses the Sun cpp specific output for # line "file"
		lines in order to be usable for rpcgen(1) and dtrace(1)

	-	cpp now converts newlines from actual macro parameters
		by spaces. This is needed in case that cpp is used to
		preprocess code for the assembler.
