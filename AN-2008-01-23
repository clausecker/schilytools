New features with AN-2008-01-23:

-	The Schily Makefile system has been enhanced to install
	the profiled version of the archives in a sub-directory "profiled".
	This is done via a new macro SUBINSDIR=

-	In order to allow better dealing with Solaris linker Mapfiles,
	a getfp() function (calling abort(3)) is created when it is not
	possible to implement this function because of compiler constraints.

-	cdrecord/readcd/cdda2wav now support an enhanced /etc/default/cdrecord file
	with an additional parameter to specify the max. transfer size for a device.

-	CDR_FORCESPEED=any now works for cdrecord to switch off DMA speed test results

-	smake no longer dumps core when parsing pattern matching default rules that 
	have no dependencies.

-	smake now supports parsing pattern matching default rules with no dependencies.

-	Fixed a star man page bug

-	Better documentation for incremental backups in the star man page
