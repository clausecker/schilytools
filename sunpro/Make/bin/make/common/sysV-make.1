.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
This is the
.B vanilla
System V version of
.BR make .
If the
environment variable
.B USE_SVR4_MAKE
.RB "is set, then the command" " make"
will invoke this version of
.BR make .
.RB "(See also the" " ENVIRONMENT"
section.)
.sp
.LP
.B make
allows the programmer to maintain, update, and regenerate groups
of computer programs.
.B make
executes commands in
.I makefile
to
update one or more target
.I names
.RI ( names
are typically programs).
If the
.B -f
option is not present, then
.BR makefile ,
.BR Makefile ,
and the Source Code Control System (SCCS) files
.B s.makefile
and
.B s.Makefile
are tried in order. If
.I makefile
is
.RB ` \(mi \&'
the
standard input is taken. More than one
.BR -f " "
.I makefile
argument pair
may appear.
.sp
.LP
.B make
updates a target only if its dependents are newer than the
target. All prerequisite files of a target are added recursively to the list
of targets. Missing files are deemed to be outdated.
.sp
.LP
The following list of four directives can be included in
.I makefile
to
extend the options provided by
.BR make .
They are used in
.I makefile
as if they were targets:
.sp

.mk
.na
\fB\&.DEFAULT:\fR
.ad

.rt
If a file must be made but there are no explicit commands or relevant
built-in rules, the commands associated with the name \fB\&.DEFAULT\fR are
used if it exists.

.RE

.SS "Creating the makefile"
.sp
.LP
The makefile invoked with the
.B -f
option is a carefully structured
file of explicit instructions for updating and regenerating programs, and
contains a sequence of entries that specify dependencies.  The first line of
an entry is a blank-separated, non-null list of targets, then a
.RB ` : ',
then a (possibly null) list of prerequisite files or dependencies. Text
following a
.RB ` ; '
and all following lines that begin with a tab are
shell commands to be executed to update the target. The first non-empty line
that does not begin with a tab or
.RB ` # '
begins a new dependency or macro
definition. Shell commands may be continued across lines with a
backslash-new-line (\fB\e\fR-NEWLINE) sequence. Everything printed by make
(except the initial TAB) is passed directly to the shell as is. Thus,
.sp
.in +2
.nf
echo a\e
b
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
will produce
.sp
.LP
.B ab
.sp
.LP
exactly the same as the shell would.
.sp
.LP
Number-sign
.RB ( # )
and
.B NEWLINE
surround comments including
contained `\fB\e\fR\(miNEWLINE' sequences.
.sp
.LP
The following makefile says that
.B pgm
depends on two files
.BR a.o
and
.BR b.o ,
and that they in turn depend on their corresponding source
files (\fBa.c\fR and
.BR b.c )
and a common file
.BR incl.h :
.sp
.in +2
.nf
pgm: a.o b.o
        cc a.o b.o -o pgm
a.o: incl.h a.c
        cc -c a.c
b.o: incl.h b.c
        cc -c b.c
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Command lines are executed one at a time, each by its own shell. The
.B SHELL
environment variable can be used to specify which shell
.B make
should use to execute commands. The default is
.BR /usr/bin/sh .
The first one or two characters in a command can be the following:
`\fB@\fR', `\fB\(mi\fR\&', `\fB@\(mi\fR', or `\fB\(mi@\fR\&'. If `\fB@\fR'
is present, printing of the command is suppressed. If `\fB\(mi\fR\&' is
present,
.B make
ignores an error. A line is printed when it is executed
unless the
.B -s
option is present, or the entry \fB\&.SILENT:\fR is
included in
.IR makefile ,
or unless the initial character sequence
contains a
.BR @ .
The
.B -n
option specifies printing without
execution; however, if the command line has the string
.B $(MAKE)
in it,
the line is always executed (see the discussion of the
.B MAKEFLAGS
macro
in the
.B "make Environment"
sub-section below). The
.B -t
(touch)
option updates the modified date of a file without executing any commands.
.sp
.LP
Commands returning non-zero status normally terminate
.BR make .
If the
.B -i
option is present, if the entry \fB\&.IGNORE:\fR is included in
.IR makefile ,
or if the initial character sequence of the command contains
`\fB\(mi\fR\&', the error is ignored. If the
.B -k
option is present,
work is abandoned on the current entry, but continues on other branches that
do not depend on that entry.
.sp
.LP
Interrupt and quit cause the target to be deleted unless the target is a
dependent of the directive
.BR \&.PRECIOUS .
.SS "make Environment"
.sp
.LP
The environment is read by
.BR make .
All variables are assumed to be
macro definitions and are processed as such. The environment variables are
processed before any makefile and after the internal rules; thus, macro
assignments in a makefile override environment variables. The
.B -e
option causes the environment to override the macro assignments in a
makefile. Suffixes and their associated rules in the makefile will override
any identical suffixes in the built-in rules.
.sp
.LP
The
.B MAKEFLAGS
environment variable is processed by
.B make
as
containing any legal input option (except
.B -f
and
.BR -p )
defined for
the command line. Further, upon invocation, \fBmake\fR "invents" the
variable if it is not in the environment, puts the current options into it,
and passes it on to invocations of commands. Thus,
.B MAKEFLAGS
always
contains the current input options. This feature proves very useful for
"super-makes". In fact, as noted above, when the \fB-n\fR option is used,
the command
.B $(MAKE)
is executed anyway; hence, one can perform a
.B make -n
recursively on a whole software system to see what would
have been executed. This result is possible because the
.B -n
is put in
.B MAKEFLAGS
and passed to further invocations of
.BR $(MAKE) .
This
usage is one way of debugging all of the makefiles for a software project
without actually doing anything.
.SS "Include Files"
.sp
.LP
If the string
.I include
appears as the first seven letters of a line in
a
.IR makefile ,
and is followed by a blank or a tab, the rest of the line
is assumed to be a filename and will be read by  the current invocation,
after substituting for any macros.
.SS "Macros"
.sp
.LP
Entries of the form
.I string1
.B =
.I string2
are macro
definitions.
.I string2
is defined as all characters up to a comment
character or an unescaped NEWLINE. Subsequent appearances of
\fB$\fR(\fIstring1\fR[\fB:\fIsubst1\fB=\fR[\fIsubst2\fR]])
are replaced by
.IR string2 .
The parentheses are optional if a
single-character macro name is used and there is no substitute sequence. The
optional
.RI : subst1 =\fIsubst2\fR
is a substitute sequence. If it is
specified, all non-overlapping occurrences of
.I subst1
in the named
macro are replaced by
.IR subst2 .
Strings (for the purposes of this type
of substitution) are delimited by BLANKs, TABs, NEWLINE characters, and
beginnings of lines. An example of the use of the substitute sequence is
shown in the
.B Libraries
sub-section below.
.SS "Internal Macros"
.sp
.LP
There are five internally maintained macros that are useful for writing
rules for building targets.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B $*
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
The macro
.B $*
stands for the filename part of the current dependent
with the suffix deleted. It is evaluated only for inference rules.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B $@
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
The
.B $@
macro stands for the full target name of the current target.
It is evaluated only for explicitly named dependencies.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B $<
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
The
.B $<
macro is only evaluated for inference rules or the
\fB\&.DEFAULT\fR rule. It is the module that is outdated with respect to the
target (the "manufactured" dependent file name). Thus, in the \fB\&.c.o\fR
rule, the
.B $<
macro would evaluate to the \fB\&.c\fR file. An example
for making optimized \fB\&.o\fR files from \fB\&.c\fR files is:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\&.c.o:
        cc c O $*.c
.fi
.in -2
.sp

or:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\&.c.o:
        cc c O $<
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B $?
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
The
.B $?
macro is evaluated when explicit rules from the makefile are
evaluated. It is the list of prerequisites that are outdated with respect to
the target, and essentially those modules that must be rebuilt.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
.B $%
.ad
.RS 6n
.rt
The
.B $%
macro is only evaluated when the target is an archive library
member of the form
.BR lib(file.o) .
In this case,
.B $@
evaluates to
.B lib
and
.B $%
evaluates to the library member,
.BR file.o .
.RE

.sp
.LP
Four of the five macros can have alternative forms. When an upper case
.B D
or
.B F
is appended to any of the four macros, the meaning is
changed to "directory part" for \fBD\fR and "file part" for \fBF\fR. Thus,
.B $(@D)
refers to the directory part of the string
.BR $@ .
If there is
no directory part, \fB\&./\fR is generated. The only macro excluded from
this alternative form is
.BR $? .
.SS "Suffixes"
.sp
.LP
Certain names (for instance, those ending with \fB\&.o\fR) have inferable
prerequisites such as \fB\&.c\fR, \fB\&.s\fR, etc. If no update commands for
such a file appear in
.IR makefile ,
and if an inferable prerequisite
exists, that prerequisite is compiled to make the target. In this case,
.B make
has inference rules that allow building files from other files by
examining the suffixes and determining an appropriate inference rule to use.
The current default inference rules are:

.TE

.sp
.LP
The internal rules for
.B make
are contained in the source file
.B make.rules
for the
.B make
program. These rules can be locally
modified. To print out the rules compiled into the
.B make
on any machine
in a form suitable for re-compilation, the following command is used:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
make -pf \(mi2>/dev/null < /dev/null
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
A tilde in the above rules refers to an SCCS file (see
.BR sccsfile (4)).
Thus, the rule \fB\&.c~.o\fR would transform an SCCS C source file into an
object file (\fB\&.o\fR). Because the
.B s.
of the SCCS files is a
prefix, it is incompatible with the
.B make
suffix point of view. Hence,
the tilde is a way of changing any file reference into an SCCS file
reference.
.sp
.LP
A rule with only one suffix (for example, \fB\&.c:\fR) is the definition of
how to build
.I x
from \fIx\fB\&.c\fR. In effect, the other suffix is
null. This feature is useful for building targets from only one source file,
for example, shell procedures and simple C programs.
.sp
.LP
Additional suffixes are given as the dependency list for
.BR \&.SUFFIXES .
Order is significant: the first possible name for which both a file and a
rule exist is inferred as a prerequisite. The default list is:
.sp
.LP
\fB\&.SUFFIXES: .o .c .c~ .y .y~ .l .l~ .s .s~ .sh .sh~ .h .h~ .f .f~\fR
\fB\&.C .C~ .Y .Y~ .L .L~\fR
.sp
.LP
Here again, the above command for printing the internal rules will display
the list of suffixes implemented on the current machine. Multiple suffix
lists accumulate; \fB\&.SUFFIXES:\fR with no dependencies clears the list of
suffixes.
.SS "Inference Rules"
.sp
.LP
The first example can be done more briefly.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
pgm: a.o b.o
    cc a.o b.o o pgm
a.o b.o: incl.h
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
This abbreviation is possible because
.B make
has a set of internal
rules for building files. The user may add rules to this list by simply
putting them in the
.IR makefile .
.sp
.LP
Certain macros are used by the default inference rules to permit the
inclusion of optional matter in any resulting commands. Again, the previous
method for examining the current rules is recommended.
.sp
.LP
The inference of prerequisites can be controlled. The rule to create a file
with suffix \fB\&.o\fR from a file with suffix \fB\&.c\fR is specified as an
entry with \fB\&.c.o:\fR as the target and no dependents. Shell commands
associated with the target define the rule for making a \fB\&.o\fR file from
a \fB\&.c\fR file. Any target that has no slashes in it and starts with a
dot is identified as a rule and not a true target.
.SS "Libraries"
.sp
.LP
If a target or dependency name contains parentheses, it is assumed to be an
archive library, the string within parentheses referring to a member within
the library. Thus,
.BR lib(file.o) " and "
.B $(LIB)(file.o)
both refer to
an archive library that contains
.BR file.o .
(This example assumes the
.B LIB
macro has been previously defined.)  The expression
.B $(LIB)(file1.o file2.o)
is not legal. Rules pertaining to archive
libraries have the form \fB\&.\fIXX\fB\&.a\fR where the
.I XX
is the suffix from which the archive member is to be
made. An unfortunate by-product of the current implementation requires the
.I XX
to be different from the suffix of the archive member.
Thus, one cannot have
.BR lib(file.o) " depend upon "
.B file.o
explicitly.
The most common use of the archive interface follows. Here, we assume the
source files are all C type source:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
lib:	lib(file1.o) lib(file2.o) lib(file3.o)
	@echo lib is now up-to-date
\&.c.a:
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $<
	$(AR) $(ARFLAGS) $@ $*.o
        rm -f $*.o
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
In fact, the \fB\&.c.a\fR rule listed above is built into
.B make
and is
unnecessary in this example. A more interesting, but more limited example of
an archive library maintenance construction follows:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
lib:	lib(file1.o) lib(file2.o) lib(file3.o)
        $(CC) -c $(CFLAGS) $(?:.o=.c)
	$(AR) $(ARFLAGS) lib $?
	rm $?
	@echo lib is now up-to-date
\&.c.a:;
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
Here the substitution mode of the macro expansions is used. The
.B $?
list is defined to be the set of object filenames (inside
.BR lib )
whose C
source files are outdated. The substitution mode translates the \fB\&.o\fR
to \fB\&.c\fR. (Unfortunately, one cannot as yet transform to \fB\&.c~\fR;
however, this transformation may become possible in the future.)  Also note
the disabling of the \fB\&.c.a:\fR rule, which would have created each
object file, one by one. This particular construct speeds up archive library
maintenance considerably. This type of construct becomes very cumbersome if
the archive library contains a mix of assembly programs and C programs.
