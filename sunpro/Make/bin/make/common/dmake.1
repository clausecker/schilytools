.LP
.SH DESCRIPTION
This man page supplements the man page for the Solaris
.BR make (1s)
utility.
.LP
This version of
.BR dmake (1)
implements a subset of the features of the
.BR dmake (1)
program delivered with the
.B Sun Studio
compiler suite.
It implements
.B serial
and
.B parallel
mode, but neither the
.B distributed
nor the
.B grid
mode.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 24
.BI \-c\  dmake-rcfile
This version of
.B dmake
neither supports the default configuration file
.B $(HOME)/.dmakerc
nor an alternate location specified by the
.B \-c
option.
.TP
.BI \-g\  dmake-group
This version of
.B dmake
does not support to set a dmake group via the
.B \-g
option.
.TP
.BI \-j\  dmake-max-jobs
Specifies the maximum total number of jobs that are
run in parallel.
.TP
.BR \-m\  { serial " | " parallel }
Allows to specify one of the following key words:
.RS
.TP 10
.B serial
Causes
.B dmake
to behave like the standard serial version of
.BR make .
.TP
.B parallel
Causes
.B dmake
to run several jobs in parallel on the
.B dmake
host.
.RE
.TP
.BI \-o\  dmake-odir
This version of
.B dmake
does not support to set a common physical directory via the
.B \-o
option.
.TP
.BI \-O\  filedesc
This version of
.B dmake
does not support to set a file descriptor to send job start
and result messages to using the
.B \-O
option.
.TP
.B \-R
Do not run in parallel mode.
.TP
.PD 0
.BI "\-x SUN_MAKE_COMPAT_MODE=" value
.TP
.BI "\-x DMAKE_OUTPUT_MODE=" value
.PD
Allows to set the
.B dmake
compat mode or the output mode.
See
.B ENVIRONMENT
for more information.

.SH USAGE
.LP
For the general usage, see the
.BR make (1s)
man page for more information.

.SS Special-purpose Targets
.B dmake
supports the
.B "special targets"
.SM \fB.PARALLEL\fP\s0,
.SM \fB.NO_PARALLEL\fP\s0,
.SM \fB.NOTPARALLEL\fP\s0,
.SM \fB.LOCAL\fP\s0,
and
.SM \fB.WAIT\fP
to control the way the targets are made.

.br
.ne 3
.TP 17
.SM \fB.NO_PARALLEL\fP:
Add targets to the dependency list of this target to control
which targets are to be processed serially.
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.SM \fB.NOTPARALLEL\fP:
When this special target is seen in a makefile, all targets
in this
.B dmake
instance are processed serially.
Sub-makes may still run in parallel mode.
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.SM \fB.PARALLEL\fP:
Add targets to the dependency list of this target to control
which targets are to be processed in parallel.
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.SM \fB.LOCAL\fP:
Add targets to the dependency list of this target to control
which targets are to be processed serially on the local host.
This version of
.B dmake
does not support distributed builds.
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.SM \fB.WAIT\fP
When this target is specified in a dependency list,
.B dmake
waits until the dependencies to the left of the
.SM \fB.WAIT\fP
pseudo target are finished before starting to process
targets to the right of
.SM \fB.WAIT\fP.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT/MACROS"
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.SM \fBDMAKE_ADJUST_MAX_JOBS\fP
This macro allows to control the parallel make behavior.
The following values are possible:
.RS
.TP
.B YES
Allow
.B dmake
to control the number of jobs based on the current system load.
If the load is high, the number of jobs will be reduced.
If the load is low, the number of jobs specified by the user is used.
.TP
.B NO
The number of jobs is not adjusted based on the load of the system.
.TP
.B M2
The number of jobs is adjusted based on the total number of jobs
run by the current group of running
.B make
programs.
This is implemented via shared memory that is set up between
recursively called make programs.
.RE
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.SM \fBDMAKE_GROUP\fP
This version of
.B dmake
does not support to set a dmake group via the
.B DMAKE_GROUP
environment or macro.
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.SM \fBDMAKE_MAX_JOBS\fP
Allows to set the maximum number of jobs in case that
.B \-j
was not specified.
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.SM \fBDMAKE_MODE\fP
May contain one of the following key words:
.RS
.TP 10
.B serial
Causes
.B dmake
to behave like the standard serial version of
.BR make .
.TP
.B parallel
Causes
.B dmake
to run several jobs in parallel on the
.B dmake
host.
.RE
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.SM \fBDMAKE_ODIR\fP
This version of
.B dmake
does not support to set the
.I dmake-odir
via the
.B DMAKE_ODIR
environment or macro.
.TP
.SM \fBDMAKE_OUTPUT_MODE\fP
Controls the output format used by
.BR dmake .
The following values are possible:
.RS
.TP 8
.B TXT1
The default behavior.
Serialize stdout and stderr, and print a label before the output
from a new job starts.
.TP
.B TXT2
Serialize stdout and stderr, but do not print the labels from
.B TXT1
mode.
.RE
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.SM \fBDMAKE_RCFILE\fP
This version of
.B dmake
neither supports the default configuration file
.B $(HOME)/.dmakerc
nor an alternate location specified by the
.B DMAKE_RCFILE
environment or macro.
