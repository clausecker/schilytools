New features with AN-2019-08-13:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. If your smake is too old and aborts, ensure this
	*** by calling:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4
	The recent smake version is smake-1.3

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-01-26 introduced
	*** optimizations for the Schily version of SunPro Make, you
	*** need at least the dmake version from 2018/01/11 with support
	*** for the "export" directive to compile with this makefile system.


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	BUG WARNING: Please never report bugs to Linux distributions as they
		usually do not forward these bug reports upstream and as the
		Linux distributions typically do not let skilled people check
		the bugs. We did not hear about a FIFO problem in star for a
		long time and since the problem that (on Linux) occurred once
		every 6000-10000 tries did not happen on Solaris after
		10 million tries, it was not known otherwise.


-	Makefilesystem: a new link RULES/sparc64-openbsd-gcc.rul has been
	introduced.

-	Makefilesystem: The files RULES/*-openbsd-*cc.rul now use automatic
	bittness setup.

-	include/schily/nlsdefs.h now casts the dummy gettext() to char *
	in order to avoid a compiler warning.

-	libschily: Various functions and *at() emulation functions call stat()
	even though the caller does not know about that call.

	This could cause a missbehavior in case that a file returns EOVERFLOW
	with a normal stat(). We now compile these functions in unconditional
	large file mode to overcome that problem.

	The affected files are:

	diropen.c lutimens.c findinpath.c linkat.c mkdirs.c searchinpath.c
	resolvepath.c  lchmod.c renameat.c 

	Note that this problem affected star(1) on platforms that do not
	fully implement all *at() interfaces, since star started to support
	really long path names in July 2018.

-	cpp: A new option -B allows to honor C++ comment.

	This option was available in the Closed Source Solaris implementation
	as well, but it was missing from the Reiser original source.

-	cpp: The man page now mentions the cpp directives and documents the
	environment variable SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES.

-	cpp: The exit code is no longer incremented on each error but rather
	set to 1.

	The old method could result in an apparent exit(0) since the historic
	wait() interface only supports the low 8 bits of the exit() parameter,
	many programs do not use waitid() and Linux even implements a
	completely broken waitid() that does not return all 32 bits from
	eht exit() call.

-	cpp: #error now prints an error message on stderr and immediately
	exits. This exit(1) only happens in case that #error is in 
	conditional active code like:

		#if 1
		#error abort
		#endif

-	cpp: A new option -p is similar to -T but in addition also checks
	for extra text after directives and gives the warning:

		"extra tokens (ignored) after directive"

	if such text was found.

	This option was available in the Closed Source Solaris implementation
	as well, but it was missing from the Reiser original source.

	We now support all documented options from the Closed Source Solaris
	cpp and some undocumented options in addition.

-	cpp: A fix from June 2018 for the warn character 0xFE that allowed
	
		#define	foo	þ

	to work caused a problem that prevented cpp from working correctly
	while compiling OpenSolaris-ON. The bug was to check the wrong 
	offset for the second warn character 0xFE, when 0xFE is escaped.

	This new version has been verified by being used in a "nightly" 
	compilation of OpenSolaris-ON.

	We definitely need a conformance test suite for cpp...

-	cpp: a basic set of conformance tests has been added.

-	cpp: New version -> 2.3

-	star: Star did not compile on platforms without ACLs anymore since
	we did rearrange the code with schilytools 2019-07-15.

	We now have the needed #undef USE_ACL in diff.c as well.

	Thanks to Dennis Clarke for reporting.

-	star: Avoid a warning when a star -dump archive is unpacked on FreeBSD
	or Linux with non-contiguous minor bits. The warning is not needed
	since we only use SCHILY.dev in order to detect mount points but
	not to compute the major/minor parts.

-	mkisofs: The struct attrinfo in apple.h has been enhanced by the
	struct members objid_low, objid_high, rsrc_length. This is what
	other projects in the net use since a while.

	If you get problems with the Apple extensions of mkisofs and like
	to use the old version of struct attrinfo, compile mkisofs with 

		smake COPTX=-DAPPLE_PEARSON_OLD

-	SunPro Make: The statement "using namespace std;" has been made conditional
	in order to support a compilation using the pre ANSI mode from the old
	Sun C++ compiler that does not support "using namespace std;".

	This mode is needed in order to support a compilation using the
	build environment from OpenSolaris-ON. It is enabled with the Sun CC
	compiler by using the option -compat=4 instead of the default -compat=5

-	smake: Added some code to trick out GCC that warns on a so called
	bit loss while enlarging the fastalloc() size parameter for alignment
	purposes.


-	SCCS TODO:

	-	Convert sccs.c to use -NSCCS in the back end programs instead
		of converting g-file names from the command line into s.file
		names in the frontend in order to forward s.file names to the
		backend programs. Doing it this way allows us to have the SCCS
		history files "off tree" in a separate directory tree starting
		with ".sccs/" at the "project root" directory, as the related
		code to convert path names is in libcomobj::bulkprepare().

	-	Add code to admin(1) and delta(1) to retrieve the list of
		new or modified files in order to have all important code
		for a "sccs commit" in a single program that does not need to
		deal with ARG_MAX limitations.

	-	Add code to admin(1), delta(1) and get(1) to maintain/understand
		the changeset file.

	-	Add code to libcomobj to understand the changeset file,
		which is needed in order to e.g. know the file names and file
		specific SIDs/state that correspond to a project global SID.

	-	Add code to all programs to maintain a lock (for the file
		$PROJECTHOME/.sccs/SCCS/s.changeset, that would be in the file
		$PROJECTHOME/.sccs/SCCS/z.changeset) to maintain a project
		global lock.

	-	Find/verify a complete transactional model that allows to repair
		complex changes to the set of files for a project that have
		been aborted in the middle. The current idea is to create the
		file $PROJECTHOME/.sccs/changeset with the deltas to the
		changeset during a complex update operation.

	-	Find a way to decide when to use SCCS v6 type history files.
		For the project mode, this is needed in order to prevent 
		historic SCCS implementations to believe they could modify
		files without knowing about project global locks.





-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.

-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
