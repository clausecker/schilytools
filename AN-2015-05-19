New features with AN-2015-05-19:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thouroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	libschily/getargs.c now is more careful with calling va_arg()
	and only calls it as many times as a related format is found in the
	format string.

-	libschily now contains a getdelim() implementation and always uses
	getdelim() to implement the fgetaline() function.

-	libschily: the *mem.c implementations now include new *mexval()
	functions to set the exit code on failure to a static value instead
	of the default "errno" value for the failure.

-	libschily: the linker map file now also lists the forgotten new entries:
	strlcatl() and wcslcatl()

-	libsiconv: the forgotten sic_base() was added to the linker map file

-	libfind: the forgotten entries find_hasexec() and find_hasprint()
	have been added to the linker map file

-	Patch: The arbitrary limit MAXHUNKSIZE has been removed

-	Patch: the previous line length limit (8192 bytes) has been removed.
	patch now supports an arbitrary line length as long as memory serves.

-	Patch: An "out of memory" situation is now handled more carefully.
	Recovery from Pan A to Plan B may now work again.

-	Patch: exit() codes are now POSIX compliant.

-	Patch: The man page now documents the differences between patch,
	traditional patch and gpatch.

-	Patch: The method to detect ED scripts was enhanced. Before, patch
	could believe that parts of a multi patch script were comment where the
	same patches put into separte files worked fine.

-	Patch: The man page now documents the patch file format and the
	filename determination algorithm.

-	Patch: A typo from the old ages from before 1990 was fixed. Patch no
	longer complains about a non-existing write error on stdout.

-	Patch: New option -W with the folowing meaning:

	-W+	Allow extensions to the strict POSIX behavior.
		-W is the POSIX option reserved to vendor unique behavior
		so implementing -W is OK for a strict POSIX program.

	-Wall	Revert to old Larry Wall behavior.
		This currenty only affects the algorithm for
		Filename Determination and causes patch to use the shortest
		name from old and new name. The default it to let the
		original filename win.

	-Wposix	Switch tp POSIX behavior

-	Patch: If called as "sccspatch", patch now defaults to POSIX behavior
	with extensions enabled. "patch" and "spatch" default to strict
	POSIX as before and "opatch" defaults to pre-POSIX behavior except
	for the filename determination.

-	Patch: If there is a failing "normal" patch that starts with a delete
	only hunk, patch no longer tries to reverse the patch as a context
	free insertion will always succeed but makes no sense.

-	Patch: now passes extensive systematic tests that use random files
	with random differences.

-	Patch: Version is now 3.0
