New features with AN-2019-02-18:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. If your smake is too old and aborts, ensure this
	*** by calling:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4
	The recent smake version is smake-1.3

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-01-26 introduced
	*** optimizations for the Schily version of SunPro Make, you
	*** need at least the dmake version from 2018/01/11 with support
	*** for the "export" directive to compile with this makefile system.


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	BUG WARNING: Please never report bugs to Linux distributions as they
		usually do not forward these bug reports upstream and as the
		Linux distributions typically do not let skilled people check
		the bugs. We did not hear about a FIFO problem in star for a
		long time and since the problem that (on Linux) occurred once
		every 6000-10000 tries did not happen on Solaris after
		10 million tries, it was not known otherwise.

-	smake (psmake): a missing link to libschily/strnlen.c has been added.

	Thanks to Rolf Dietze for reporting.

-	star: another similar has been fixed similat to what has been fixed
	already in the 2019-01-22 release:

	An even less frequent FIFO problem (occurs once every 50 million
	tries on fast multi CPU machines) has been identified. Star reports a
	hard EOF on input even though the complete file with logical EOF has
	been read and there is still input to process. In order to debug this
	problem a debug message has been added to the code.

	With this debug message, it turned out, that this problem happened
	because a context switch occurred in the FIFO read process after it did
	see an empty FIFO and later, after the process was resumed, the
	following check for the FIFO_MEOF flag did see EOF. We now first check
	for the FIFO_MEOF flag and later for the amount of data inside as the
	FIFO as FIFO_MEOF is set after the FIFO content has been updated and
	thus a context switch is no longer able to cause a wrong assumption
	about the content of the FIFO.

	We now did run 250 million tests without seeing another problem.

	If you still see this, please send a report.

-	star: Note that the debug output for this problem now has been
	disabled. If you need to debug this, call:

		smake clean COPTX=-DFIFO_EOF_DEBUG all

	in the star directory.

-	star: The message "Sync pipe read error" is no longer printed when
	the FIFO background process dies instead of sending a final wakeup.
	This is needed since there is a possibility for a context switch in
	the foreground process that can make it later wait for a wakeup while
	the background process misses to see the wait flag and just exits.

-	star: In rare conditions (once every 2 million tries), a hang could 
	occur with "star -c" if the tar process fills the FIFO and sets the
	EOF flag and then calls wait() to wait for the FIFO tape output
	process. This happens in case that the tape output did not see the
	EOF flag because it has undergone a context switch after it checked
	for the not yet existing EOF flag and before waiting for a wakeup
	from the tar FIFO fill process.

	Star now closes the sync pipes before calling wait() as this always
	wakes up the waiting other side.

	We did run another 300 million tests for this condition and did not
	see any problem now.

-	star: The version is now 1.6

	Short overview for what changed since the last "stable" version:

	-	Support for "infinitely" long path names has been added.

	-	Support for comparing timestamps with nanosecond granularity

	-	-secure-links has been made the default when extracting
		archived (except when doing an incremental restore).

	-	Added Support for NFSv4 ACLs on FreeBSD. Solaris has been
		supported since 2013.

	-	Added Support to archive SELinix attributes.

	-	Allow to configure whether "star -fsync" is the default in
		order to support filesystems that are slow with granted
		transactions (like ZFS) or platforms that are genrally
		slow with fsync() (like Linux).

	-	Full UNICODE support has been added for tar headers.

	-	Support for -zstd compression has been added.

	-	Some rare FIFO problems have been fixed.
		Note that we did recently run more than a billion tests to
		verify the FIFO after we identified a method to trigger the
		problem on Linux.

-	Bourne Shell: Another vfork() problem has been fixed. "trap cmd EXIT"
	has incorrectly called "cmd" after a non-existing command was 
	called by the shell. This was a result of the shared data from vfork().

	Thanks to Martijn Dekker for reporting.

-	Bourne Shell: A unit test case for the above bug has been added.

-	Bourne Shell: __growstak() now always uses realloc() on modern
	platforms. This may speed up things up to 15%.

	Thanks to Jan Engelhardt for reporting.


-	SCCS TODO:

	-	Convert sccs.c to use -NSCCS in the back end programs instead
		of converting g-file names from the command line into s.file
		names in the frontend in order to forward s.file names to the
		backend programs. Doing it this way allows us to have the SCCS
		history files "off tree" in a separate directory tree starting
		with ".sccs/" at the "project root" directory, as the related
		code to convert path names is in libcomobj::bulkprepare().

	-	Add code to admin(1) and delta(1) to retrieve the list of
		new or modified files in order to have all important code
		for a "sccs commit" in a single program that does not need to
		deal with ARG_MAX limitations.

	-	Add code to admin(1), delta(1) and get(1) to maintain/understand
		the changeset file.

	-	Add code to libcomobj to understand the changeset file,
		which is needed in order to e.g. know the file names and file
		specific SIDs/state that correspond to a project global SID.

	-	Add code to all programs to maintain a lock (for the file
		$PROJECTHOME/.sccs/SCCS/s.changeset, that would be in the file
		$PROJECTHOME/.sccs/SCCS/z.changeset) to maintain a project
		global lock.

	-	Find/verify a complete transactional model that allows to repair
		complex changes to the set of files for a project that have
		been aborted in the middle. The current idea is to create the
		file $PROJECTHOME/.sccs/changeset with the deltas to the
		changeset during a complex update operation.

	-	Find a way to decide when to use SCCS v6 type history files.
		For the project mode, this is needed in order to prevent 
		historic SCCS implementations to believe they could modify
		files without knowing about project global locks.





-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.

-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
