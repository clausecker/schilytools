New features with AN-2011-06-22:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****


-	Schily.Copyright updated for "cpp" and "patch"

-	COPYING updated for "cpp" and "patch"

-	A new rule RULES/profiled.lnk allows to call:

	smake COPTX=-pg LDOPTX=-pg LINKMODE=profiled

	to create binaries that use gprof.

-	New function permtostr() in libschily allows to convert a
	mode_t like stat.st_mode into a chmod compliant string like:

		u=rw,g=r,o=r

	that is accepted by libschily::getperm() to allow a  conversion
	back to a mode_t variable.

-	libschily::rename() now uses mktemp() to temorarily save the
	rename target file.

-	libscg::scsi-aix.c was updated with some experimental code to support
	two new SCSI kernel interfaces on AIX.

-	star::longnames.c now uses a hack with a 101 char array t_name
	to avoid an incorrect buffer overflow warning from gcc.

-	star no longer replaces the out of range time stamps from the
	extended header times by the current time but uses the
	time stamp from the standard header. *** What it the right
	way to go here? ***

-	All SCCS commands now remember upper case option letters in the
	extended had[] array.

-	A new help text for the new admin error message (ad35) was added.

-	SCCS admin and rmchg now use gpkt.p_file instead of the hacky
	(char *)&gpkt

-	The function mkgmtime() has been moved to libschily

-	The SCCS prs command now supports two new keywords:

	:G:	The base name of the file. This is "file" for a history
		file name "s.file"

	:D_:	yyyy-mm-dd for a delta

-	The diff command now includes the nanosecond value for the time
	stamp with "diff -u" in case it is run on an OS that supports
	sub-second file time stamps.

-	Several SCCS man pages have been updated to include a better and more
	complete description of the various files and their prefixes.

-	The sccs-delta.1 man page now tries to avoid a confusion with the 
	exit code when using -d

-	The bugs in the lock file mechanism introduced by Sun have been
	removed. SCCS is now again able to automatically recover from
	a sccs program killed by a signal during the creation of a lock
	file.

-	A bug (introduced by Sun while introducing automated binary file
	support around 1986) was fixed. SCCS no longer incorrectly asumes
	a binary file in case that a long line (longer than BUFSIZ) contains
	a ^A character at BUFSIZ offset.

-	SCCS no longer calls link() and thus is now portable to platforms
	that do not support hard links (such as BeOS).

-	The SCCS performance has been enhanced. This includes fixing
	some oddities that caused SCCS to call read(2)/write(2) with
	a bytecount of 1016.

	-	SCCS "admin -n -ifile" (to create a new SCCS history file)
		is now typically 4x faster than "Sun SCCS" admin.

	-	A typical edit chain "get -e" followed by "delta" is now
		typically 50% faster than "Sun SCCS".

	-	SCCS is now typically 4x-6x faster than GNU CSSC
		As CSSC slows down by ndeltas**2, this difference may become
		larger with a high number of deltas.

	Some data to compare with other systems:

	-	SCCS is now typically 2x faster than RCS

	-	SCCS is now typically aprox. 4x-10x faster than mercurial

	-	SCCS is now typically 6x-12x faster than CVS


-	New autocof tests on whether printf supoorts %lld and %jd

-	bdiff and the SCCS basic command now try to avoid to link against printf
	from libschily in case that the lical libc supports printf("%lld") and
	printf("%jd")
