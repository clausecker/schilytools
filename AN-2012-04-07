New features with AN-2012-04-07:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	Bourne Shell: the function tdystak() now has a second parameter
	struct ionod *iosav to be able to correclty unwind the tempfile
	stak used for here documents.

The new Bourne Shell now successfully runs a very long "configure" script.
We thus can carefully assume that there is no bug left over from the conversion
from sbrk() tp malloc().

The Bourne Shell now can be called "platform independent".
