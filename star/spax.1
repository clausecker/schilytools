.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The 
.B pax 
utility shall read, write, and write lists of the members
of archive files and copy directory hierarchies. A variety of
archive formats shall be supported; see the
.B \-x
format option.
.PP
The action to be taken depends on the presence of the
.B \-r
and
.B \-w
options. The four combinations of
.B \-r
and
.B \-w
are referred to as the
four modes of operation:
.BR list ,
.BR read ,
.BR write ,
and
.B copy
modes, corresponding respectively to the four forms shown in the SYNOPSIS
section.
.TP
.B list
In
.B list
mode (when neither
.B \-r
nor
.B \-w
are specified),
.B pax
shall write the names of the members of the archive file read
from the standard input, with pathnames matching the
specified
.IR patterns ,
to standard output. If a named file is of
type directory, the file hierarchy rooted at that file shall
be listed as well.
.TP
.B read
In
.B read
mode (when
.B \-r
is specified, but
.B \-w
is not),
.B pax
shall extract the members of the archive file read from the
standard input, with pathnames matching the specified
.IR patterns .
If an extracted file is of type directory, the file
hierarchy rooted at that file shall be extracted as well. The
extracted files shall be created performing pathname
resolution with the directory in which
.B pax
was invoked as the
current working directory.
.sp
If an attempt is made to extract a directory when the
directory already exists, this shall not be considered an
error. If an attempt is made to extract a FIFO when the FIFO
already exists, this shall not be considered an error.
.sp
The ownership, access, and modification times, and file mode
of the restored files are discussed under the
.B \-p
option.
.TP
.B write
In
.B write
mode (when
.B \-w
is specified, but
.B \-r
is not), 
.B pax
shall write the contents of the file operands to the standard
output in an archive format. If no file operands are
specified, a list of files to copy, one per line, shall be
read from the standard input. A file of type directory shall
include all of the files in the file hierarchy rooted at the
file.
.TP
.B copy
In
.B copy
mode (when both
.B \-r
and
.B \-w
are specified), 
.B pax
shall copy the file operands to the destination directory.
.sp
If no file operands are specified, a list of files to copy,
one per line, shall be read from the standard input. A file
of type directory shall include all of the files in the file
hierarchy rooted at the file.
.sp
The effect of the
.B copy
shall be as if the copied files were
written to an archive file and then subsequently extracted,
except that there may be hard links between the original and
the copied files. If the destination directory is a
subdirectory of one of the files to be copied, the results
are unspecified. If the destination directory is a file of a
type not defined by the System Interfaces volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, the results are implementation-defined;
otherwise, it shall be an error for the file named by the
directory operand not to exist, not be writable by the user,
or not be a file of type directory.
.PP
In
.B read
or 
.B copy
modes, if intermediate directories are necessary
to extract an archive member, 
.B pax 
shall perform actions equivalent
to the 
.BR mkdir ()
function defined in the System Interfaces volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, called with the following arguments:
.TP
.B \(bu
The intermediate directory used as the 
.B path
argument.
.TP
.B \(bu
The value of the bitwise-inclusive 
.B OR 
of
.BR S_IRWXU ,
.BR S_IRWXG ,
and
.B S_IRWXO
as the
.I mode
argument.
.PP
If any specified
.I pattern
or
.I file
operands are not matched by at
least one file or archive member, 
.B pax 
shall write a diagnostic
message to standard error for each one that did not match and exit
with a non-zero exit status.
.PP
The archive formats described in the 
.B EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
section
shall be automatically detected on input. The default output
archive format shall be implementation-defined.
.PP
The 
.B spax
implementation defaults to
.BR "\-x ustar" .
.PP
A single archive can span multiple files. The
.B pax
utility shall
determine, in an implementation-defined manner, what file to read
or write as the next file.
.PP
If the selected archive format supports the specification of
linked files, it shall be an error if these files cannot be linked
when the archive is extracted, except that if the files to be
linked are symbolic links and the system is not capable of making
hard links to symbolic links, then separate copies of the symbolic
link shall be created instead. For archive formats that do not
store file contents with each name that causes a hard link, if the
file that contains the data is not extracted during this
.B pax
session, either the data shall be restored from the original file,
or a diagnostic message shall be displayed with the name of a file
that can be used to extract the data. In traversing directories,
.B pax
shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a previously
visited directory that is an ancestor of the last file visited.
When it detects an infinite loop,
.B pax
shall write a diagnostic
message to standard error and shall terminate.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The
.B pax
utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines,
except that the order of presentation of the
.BR \-o ,
.BR \-p ,
and
.B \-s
options is significant.
See also the
.B "OTHER OPTIONS"
section.
.PP
The following options shall be supported:
.TP
.B \-r
Read an archive file from standard input.
.TP
.B \-w
Write files to the standard output in the specified archive
format.
.TP
.B \-a
Append files to the end of the archive. It is
implementation-defined which devices on the system support
appending. Additional file formats unspecified by this volume
of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 may impose restrictions on appending.
.TP
.BI \-b " blocksize"
Block the output at a positive decimal integer number of
bytes per write to the archive file. Devices and archive
formats may impose restrictions on blocking. Blocking shall
be automatically determined on input. Conforming applications
shall not specify a blocksize value larger than 32256.
Default blocking when creating archives depends on the
archive format. (See the 
.B \-x 
option below.)
.TP
.B \-c
Match all file or archive members except those specified by
the pattern or file operands.
.TP
.B \-d
Cause files of type directory being copied or archived or
archive members of type directory being extracted or listed
to match only the file or archive member itself and not the
file hierarchy rooted at the file.
.\".....XXX Ab hier noch nicht fertig
.TP
.BI \-f " archive"
Specify the pathname of the input or output archive,
overriding the default standard input (in 
.B list
or
.B read
modes)
or standard output 
.RB ( write 
mode).
.TP
.B \-H
If a symbolic link referencing a file of type directory is
specified on the command line, 
.B pax 
shall archive the file
hierarchy rooted in the file referenced by the link, using
the name of the link as the root of the file hierarchy.
Otherwise, if a symbolic link referencing a file of any other
file type which 
.B pax 
can normally archive is specified on the
command line, then 
.B pax 
shall archive the file referenced by
the link, using the name of the link. The default behavior
shall be to archive the symbolic link itself.
.TP
.B \-i
Interactively rename files or archive members. For each
archive member matching a pattern operand or file matching a
file operand, a prompt shall be written to the file /dev/tty.
The prompt shall contain the name of the file or archive
member, but the format is otherwise unspecified. A line shall
then be read from /dev/tty. If this line is blank, the file
or archive member shall be skipped. If this line consists of
a single period, the file or archive member shall be
processed with no modification to its name. Otherwise, its
name shall be replaced with the contents of the line. The 
.B pax
utility shall immediately exit with a non-zero exit status if
end-of-file is encountered when reading a response or if
/dev/tty cannot be opened for reading and writing.
.sp
The results of extracting a hard link to a file that has been
renamed during extraction are unspecified.
.TP
.B \-k
Prevent the overwriting of existing files.
.TP
.B \-l
(The letter ell.) In copy mode, hard links shall be made
between the source and destination file hierarchies whenever
possible. If specified in conjunction with 
.B \-H 
or 
.BR \-L ,
when a
symbolic link is encountered, the hard link created in the
destination file hierarchy shall be to the file referenced by
the symbolic link. If specified when neither 
.B \-H 
nor 
.B \-L 
is
specified, when a symbolic link is encountered, the
implementation shall create a hard link to the symbolic link
in the source file hierarchy or copy the symbolic link to the
destination.
.TP
.B \-L
If a symbolic link referencing a file of type directory is
specified on the command line or encountered during the
traversal of a file hierarchy, 
.B pax 
shall archive the file
hierarchy rooted in the file referenced by the link, using
the name of the link as the root of the file hierarchy.
Otherwise, if a symbolic link referencing a file of any other
file type which 
.B pax 
can normally archive is specified on the
command line or encountered during the traversal of a file
hierarchy, 
.B pax 
shall archive the file referenced by the link,
using the name of the link. The default behavior shall be to
archive the symbolic link itself.
.TP
.B \-n
Select the first archive member that matches each pattern
operand. No more than one archive member shall be matched for
each pattern (although members of type directory shall still
match the file hierarchy rooted at that file).
.TP
.BI \-o " options"
Provide information to the implementation to modify the
algorithm for extracting or writing files. The value of
options shall consist of one or more comma-separated keywords
of the form:
.RS
.PP
.BI          keyword[[:]= value ][,keyword[[:]= value ], .\|.\|.\|]
.PP
Some keywords apply only to certain file formats, as
indicated with each description. Use of keywords that are
inapplicable to the file format being processed produces
undefined results.
.PP
Keywords in the options argument shall be a string that would
be a valid portable filename as described in the Base
Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.276,
Portable Filename Character Set.
.TP
.B Note:
Keywords are not expected to be filenames, merely to
follow the same character composition rules as portable
filenames.
.PP
Keywords can be preceded with white space. The value field
shall consist of zero or more characters; within value, the
application shall precede any literal comma with a backslash,
which shall be ignored, but preserves the comma as part of
value. A comma as the final character, or a comma followed
solely by white space as the final characters, in options
shall be ignored. Multiple 
.B \-o 
options can be specified; if
keywords given to these multiple 
.B \-o 
options conflict, the
keywords and values appearing later in command line sequence
shall take precedence and the earlier shall be silently
ignored. The following keyword values of options shall be
supported for the file formats as indicated:
.TP
.BI delete= pattern
(Applicable only to the 
.B "\-x pax"
format.) When used in
write or copy mode, 
.B pax 
shall omit from extended header
records that it produces any keywords matching the
string pattern. When used in read or list mode, 
.B pax
shall ignore any keywords matching the string pattern in
the extended header records. In both cases, matching
shall be performed using the pattern matching notation
described in Patterns Matching a Single Character and
Patterns Matching Multiple Characters. For example:
.RS
.PP
\fB\-o\ delete=\fIsecurity.*\fR
.PP
would suppress security-related information. See 
.B pax Extended Header 
for extended header record keyword
usage.
.PP
When multiple 
.BI "\-o delete=" pattern
options are specified,
the patterns shall be additive; all keywords matching
the specified string patterns shall be omitted from
extended header records that 
.B pax 
produces.
.RE
.TP
.BI exthdr.name= string
(Applicable only to the 
.B "\-x pax"
format.) This keyword
allows user control over the name that is written into
the ustar header blocks for the extended header produced
under the circumstances described in 
.BR "pax Header Block".
The name shall be the contents of string, after the
following character substitutions have been made:
.RS
.PP
.TS
center box;
lb|lb
l|l.
string Includes:	Replaced By:
_
%d	The directory name of the file, equivalent
	to the result of the dirname utility on the
	translated pathname.
_
%f	The filename of the file, equivalent to the
	result of the basename utility on the
	translated pathname.
_
%p	The process ID of the pax process.
_
%%	A '%' character.
.TE
.PP
Any other '%' characters in string produce undefined
results.
.PP
If no \-o exthdr.name= string is specified, 
.B pax 
shall use
the following default value:
.PP
        %d/PaxHeaders.%p/%f
.PP
.RE
.TP
.BI globexthdr.name= string
(Applicable only to the 
.B "\-x pax"
format.) When used in
write or copy mode with the appropriate options, 
.B pax
shall create global extended header records with ustar
header blocks that will be treated as regular files by
previous versions of 
.BR pax .
This keyword allows user
control over the name that is written into the ustar
header blocks for global extended header records. The
name shall be the contents of string, after the
following character substitutions have been made:
.RS
.PP
.TS
center box;
lb|lb
l|l.
string Includes:	Replaced By:
_
%n	An integer that represents the sequence
	number of the global extended header record
	in the archive, starting at 1.
_
%p	The process ID of the pax process.
_
%%	A '%' character.
.TE
.PP
Any other '%' characters in string produce undefined
results.
.PP
If no 
.BI "\-o globexthdr.name=" string
is specified, 
.B pax 
shall
use the following default value:
.PP
$TMPDIR/GlobalHead.%p.%n
.PP
where 
.B $TMPDIR 
represents the value of the 
.B TMPDIR
environment variable. If 
.B TMPDIR 
is not set, 
.B pax 
shall
use /tmp.
.RE
.TP
.BI invalid= action
(Applicable only to the 
.B "\-x pax"
format.) This keyword
allows user control over the action 
.B pax 
takes upon
encountering values in an extended header record that,
in read or copy mode, are invalid in the destination
hierarchy or, in list mode, cannot be written in the
codeset and current locale of the implementation. The
following are invalid values that shall be recognized by
.BR pax :
.RS
.TP
.B +
In read or copy mode, a filename or link name that
contains character encodings invalid in the
destination hierarchy. (For example, the name may
contain embedded NULs.)
.TP
.B +
In read or copy mode, a filename or link name that
is longer than the maximum allowed in the
destination hierarchy (for either a pathname
component or the entire pathname).
.TP
.B +
In list mode, any character string value (filename,
link name, user name, and so on) that cannot be
written in the codeset and current locale of the
implementation.
.PP
The following mutually-exclusive values of the action
argument are supported:
.TP
.B bypass
In read or copy mode, 
.B pax 
shall bypass the file,
causing no change to the destination hierarchy. In
list mode, 
.B pax 
shall write all requested valid
values for the file, but its method for writing
invalid values is unspecified.
.TP
.B rename
In read or copy mode, 
.B pax 
shall act as if the 
.B \-i
option were in effect for each file with invalid
filename or link name values, allowing the user to
provide a replacement name interactively. In list
mode, 
.B pax 
shall behave identically to the bypass
action.
.TP
.B UTF-8
When used in read, copy, or list mode and a
filename, link name, owner name, or any other field
in an extended header record cannot be translated
from the 
.B pax 
UTF-8 codeset format to the codeset
and current locale of the implementation, 
.B pax 
shall
use the actual UTF-8 encoding for the name.
.TP
.B write
In read or copy mode, 
.B pax 
shall write the file,
translating the name, regardless of whether this
may overwrite an existing file with a valid name.
In list mode, 
.B pax 
shall behave identically to the
bypass action.
.PP
If no 
.BI "\-o invalid=" option
is specified, 
.B pax 
shall act as
if 
.B "\-o invalid= bypass"
were specified. Any overwriting of
existing files that may be allowed by the 
.B "\-o invalid="
actions shall be subject to permission(\fB\-p\fR) and
modification time (\fB\-u\fR) restrictions, and shall be
suppressed if the 
.B \-k 
option is also specified.
.RE
.TP
.B linkdata
(Applicable only to the 
.B "\-x pax"
format.) In write mode,
.B pax 
shall write the contents of a file to the archive
even when that file is merely a hard link to a file
whose contents have already been written to the archive.
.TP
.BI listopt= format
This keyword specifies the output format of the table of
contents produced when the 
.B \-v 
option is specified in
list mode. See List Mode Format Specifications. To avoid
ambiguity, the listopt= format shall be the only or
final keyword= value pair in a 
.BI "\-o " option-argument\fR;
all characters in the remainder of the option-argument shall
be considered part of the format string. When multiple
\-o listopt= format options are specified, the format
strings shall be considered a single, concatenated
string, evaluated in command line order.
.TP
.B times
(Applicable only to the 
.B "\-x pax"
format.) When used in
write or copy mode, 
.B pax 
shall include atime and mtime
extended header records for each file. See 
.BR "pax Extended Header File Times" .
.PP
In addition to these keywords, if the 
.B "\-x pax"
format is
specified, any of the keywords and values defined in 
.BR "pax Extended Header" ,
including implementation extensions, can be
used in 
.BI \-o " option-arguments\fR,"
in either of two modes:
.TP
.BI keyword= value
When used in write or copy mode, these keyword/value
pairs shall be included at the beginning of the archive
as typeflag g global extended header records. When used
in read or list mode, these keyword/value pairs shall
act as if they had been at the beginning of the archive
as typeflag g global extended header records.
.TP
.BI keyword:= value
When used in write or copy mode, these keyword/value
pairs shall be included as records at the beginning of a
typeflag x extended header for each file. (This shall be
equivalent to the equal-sign form except that it creates
no typeflag g global extended header records.) When used
in read or list mode, these keyword/value pairs shall
act as if they were included as records at the end of
each extended header; thus, they shall override any
global or file-specific extended header record keywords
of the same names. For example, in the command:
.RS
.PP
\fBpax \-r \-o "gname:=mygroup," <archive\fR
.PP
the group name will be forced to a new value for all
files read from the archive.
.RE
.PP
The precedence of 
.B \-o
keywords over various fields in the
archive is described in 
.BR "pax Extended Header Keyword Precedence" .
.RE
.TP
.BI \-p " string"
Specify one or more file characteristic options (privileges).
The string option-argument shall be a string specifying file
characteristics to be retained or discarded on extraction.
The string shall consist of the specification characters a ,
e, m, o, and p. Other implementation-defined characters can
be included. Multiple characteristics can be concatenated
within the same string and multiple 
.B \-p 
options can be
specified. The meaning of the specification characters are as
follows:
.RS
.TP
.B a
Do not preserve file access times.
.TP
.B e
Preserve the user ID, group ID, file mode bits (see the
Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section
3.168, File Mode Bits), access time, modification time,
and any other implementation-defined file
characteristics.
.TP
.B m

Do not preserve file modification times.
.TP
.B o
Preserve the user ID and group ID.
.TP
.B p
Preserve the file mode bits. Other
implementation-defined file mode attributes may be
preserved.
.PP
In the preceding list, "preserve" indicates that an attribute
stored in the archive shall be given to the extracted file,
subject to the permissions of the invoking process. The
access and modification times of the file shall be preserved
unless otherwise specified with the 
.B \-p 
option or not stored
in the archive. All attributes that are not preserved shall
be determined as part of the normal file creation action (see
File Read, Write, and Creation).
.PP
If neither the e nor the o specification character is
specified, or the user ID and group ID are not preserved for
any reason, 
.B pax 
shall not set the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits of
the file mode.
.PP
If the preservation of any of these items fails for any
reason,
.B pax 
shall write a diagnostic message to standard
error. Failure to preserve these items shall affect the final
exit status, but shall not cause the extracted file to be
deleted.
.PP
If file characteristic letters in any of the string
option-arguments are duplicated or conflict with each other,
the ones given last shall take precedence. For example, if 
.B "\-p eme"
is specified, file modification times are preserved.
.RE
.TP
.BI \-s " replstr"
Modify file or archive member names named by pattern or file
operands according to the substitution expression replstr,
using the syntax of the ed utility. The concepts of "address"
and "line" are meaningless in the context of the 
.B pax 
utility,
and shall not be supplied. The format shall be:
.RS
.PP
.B \-s /old/new/[gp]
.PP
where as in ed, old is a basic regular expression and new can
contain an ampersand, '\en' (where n is a digit)
backreferences, or subexpression matching. The old string
shall also be permitted to contain <newline>s.
.PP
Any non-null character can be used as a delimiter ( '/' shown
here). Multiple 
.B \-s 
expressions can be specified; the
expressions shall be applied in the order specified,
terminating with the first successful substitution. The
optional trailing 'g' is as defined in the ed utility. The
optional trailing 'p' shall cause successful substitutions to
be written to standard error. File or archive member names
that substitute to the empty string shall be ignored when
reading and writing archives.
.RE
.TP
.B \-t
When reading files from the file system, and if the user has
the permissions required by utime() to do so, set the access
time of each file read to the access time that it had before
being read by 
.BR pax .
.TP
.B \-u
Ignore files that are older (having a less recent file
modification time) than a pre-existing file or archive member
with the same name. In read mode, an archive member with the
same name as a file in the file system shall be extracted if
the archive member is newer than the file. In write mode, an
archive file member with the same name as a file in the file
system shall be superseded if the file is newer than the
archive member. If 
.B \-a 
is also specified, this is accomplished
by appending to the archive; otherwise, it is unspecified
whether this is accomplished by actual replacement in the
archive or by appending to the archive. In copy mode, the
file in the destination hierarchy shall be replaced by the
file in the source hierarchy or by a link to the file in the
source hierarchy if the file in the source hierarchy is
newer.
.TP

The following text is a quotation from the POSIX.1-2001 standard.
.LP
In
.B list
mode with the
.B -o
.BI listopt= format
option, the
format argument is applied for each selected file.
.B spax
appends a
NEWLINE to the
.B listopt
output for each selected file. The
.I format
argument is used as the format string with the following exceptions. (See
.BR printf (1)
for the first five exceptions.)
.TP
.B 1.
A
.B SPACE
character in the format string, in any context other than a
flag of a conversion specification, is treated as an ordinary character that
is copied to the output.
.TP
.B 2.
A \fB\&' '\fR character in the format string is treated as a \fB\&' '\fR
character, not as a SPACE.
.TP
.B 3.
In addition to the escape sequences described in the
.BR formats (7)
manual page, (\fB\e\e\fR, \fB\ea\fR, \fB\eb\fR, \fB\ef\fR, \fB\en\fR,
\fB\er\fR, \fB\et\fR, \fB\ev\fR), \fB\e\fIddd\fR, where
.I ddd
is a
one-, two-, or three-digit octal number, is written as a byte with the

.B 5.
Output from the
.B o
conversion specifier is not preceded with zeros
that are not specified by the format operand.
.TP
.B 6.
The sequence
.RI ( keyword )
can occur before a format conversion
specifier. The conversion argument is defined by the value of
.IR keyword .
The implementation shall support the following
.IR keywords :
.RS
.TP
.B \(bu
Any of the Field Name entries in ustar Header Block and
Octet-Oriented cpio Archive Entry. The implementation
may support the
.I cpio
keywords without the leading 
.B c_
in addition to the form required by Values for 
.B cpio
.B c_mode
Field.
.TP
.B \(bu
Any keyword defined for the extended header in 
.BR "pax Extended Header" .
.TP
.B \(bu
Any keyword provided as an implementation-defined
extension within the extended header defined in 
.BR "pax Extended Header" .
.PP
For example, the sequence "%(charset)s" is the string value
of the name of the character set in the extended header.

.SS "pax Header Block"
.PP
The

header block shall be identical to the
.B ustar
header block
described in
.BR "ustar Interchange Format" ,
except that two additional 
.I typeflag 
values are defined:
.TP
.B x
Represents extended header records for the following file in
the archive (which shall have its own 
.B ustar 
header block).
The format of these extended header records shall be as
described in 
.BR "pax Extended Header" .
.TP
.B g
Represents global extended header records for the following
files in the archive. The format of these extended header
records shall be as described in 
.BR "pax Extended Header" .
Each
value shall affect all subsequent files that do not override
that value in their own extended header record and until
another global extended header record is reached that
provides another value for the same field. The 
.I typeflag 
.B g
global headers should not be used with interchange media that
could suffer partial data loss in transporting the archive.
.PP
For both of these types, the size field shall be the size of the
extended header records in octets. The other fields in the header
block are not meaningful to this version of the
.B pax
utility.
However, if this archive is read by a
.B pax 
utility conforming to
the ISO POSIX\-2:1993 standard, the header block fields are used to
create a regular file that contains the extended header records as
data. Therefore, header block field values should be selected to
provide reasonable file access to this regular file.
.PP
A further difference from the 
.B ustar 
header block is that data
blocks for files of 
.I typeflag 
.B 1
(the digit one) (hard link) may be
included, which means that the size field may be greater than
zero. Archives created by 
.B "pax \-o linkdata"
shall include these data
blocks with the hard links.

.SS "pax Extended Header"
.PP
A 
.B pax 
extended header contains values that are inappropriate for
the 
.B ustar
header block because of limitations in that format:
fields requiring a character encoding other than that described in
the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard, fields representing file attributes
not described in the
.B ustar
header, and fields whose format or
length do not fit the requirements of the
.B ustar
header. The values
in an extended header add attributes to the following file (or
files; see the description of the
.I typeflag 
.B g 
header block) or
override values in the following header block(s), as indicated in
the following list of keywords.
.PP
An extended header shall consist of one or more records, each
constructed as follows:
.PP
     "%d %s=%s\en", <length>, <keyword>, <value>
.PP
The extended header records shall be encoded according to the
ISO/IEC 10646\-1:2000 standard (UTF-8). The 
.I <length> 
field,
<blank>, equals sign, and <newline> shown shall be limited to the
portable character set, as encoded in UTF-8. The 
.I <keyword> 
and
.I <value> 
fields can be any UTF-8 characters. The 
.I <length>
field
shall be the decimal length of the extended header record in
octets, including the trailing <newline>.
.PP
The
.I <keyword>
field shall be one of the entries from the following
list or a keyword provided as an implementation extension.
Keywords consisting entirely of lowercase letters, digits, and
periods are reserved for future standardization. A keyword shall
not include an equals sign. (In the following list, the notations
"file(s)" or "block(s)" is used to acknowledge that a keyword
affects the following single file after a
.I typeflag 
.B x 
extended
header, but possibly multiple files after 
.I typeflag 
.BR g . 
Any requirements in the list for 
.B pax 
to include a record when in 
.B write
or
.B copy 
mode shall apply only when such a record has not already
been provided through the use of the 
.B \-o 
option. When used in 
.B copy
mode, 
.B pax 
shall behave as if an archive had been created with
applicable extended header records and then extracted.)

.B atime
The file access time for the following file(s), equivalent to
the value of the 
.I st_atime 
member of the

A 
.B ustar 
archive tape or file shall contain a series of logical
records. Each logical record shall be a fixed-size logical record
of 512 octets (see below). Although this format may be thought of
as being stored on 9-track industry-standard 12.7 mm (0.5 in)
magnetic tape, other types of transportable media are not
excluded. Each file archived shall be represented by a header
logical record that describes the file, followed by zero or more
logical records that give the contents of the file. At the end of
the archive file there shall be two 512-octet logical records
filled with binary zeros, interpreted as an end-of-archive
indicator.
.PP
The logical records may be grouped for physical I/O operations, as

All characters in the header logical record shall be represented
in the coded character set of the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard. For
maximum portability between implementations, names should be
selected from characters represented by the portable filename
character set as octets with the most significant bit zero. If an
implementation supports the use of characters outside of slash and
the portable filename character set in names for files, users, and
groups, one or more implementation-defined encodings of these
characters shall be provided for interchange purposes.
.PP
However, the 
.B pax 
utility shall never create filenames on the local
system that cannot be accessed via the procedures described in
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. If a filename is found on the medium that
would create an invalid filename, it is implementation-defined
whether the data from the file is stored on the file hierarchy and
under what name it is stored. The 
.B pax 
utility may choose to ignore
these files as long as it produces an error indicating that the
file is being ignored.
.PP
Each field within the header logical record is contiguous; that
is, there is no padding used. Each character on the archive medium
shall be stored contiguously.
.PP
The fields 
.IR magic ,
.IR uname ,
and 
.I gname 
are character strings each
terminated by a NUL character. The fields 
.IR name ,
.IR linkname ,
and
.I prefix 
are NUL-terminated character strings except when all
characters in the array contain non-NUL characters including the
last character. The 
.I version 
field is two octets containing the
characters "00" (zero-zero). The 
.I typeflag 
contains a single
character. All other fields are leading zero-filled octal numbers
using digits from the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard IRV. Each numeric
field is terminated by one or more <space> or NUL characters.
.PP
The 
.I name 
and the 
.I prefix 
fields shall produce the pathname of the
file. A new pathname shall be formed, if 
.I prefix 
is not an empty
string (its first character is not NUL), by concatenating 
.I prefix
(up to the first NUL character), a slash character, and 
.IR name ;
otherwise, 
.I name
is used alone. In either case, 
.I name 
is terminated
at the first NUL character. If 
.I prefix 
begins with a NUL character,
it shall be ignored. In this manner, pathnames of at most 256
characters can be supported. If a pathname does not fit in the
space provided,

The

When appropriate privilege is required to set one of these mode
bits, and the user restoring the files from the archive does not
have the appropriate privilege, the mode bits for which the user
does not have appropriate privilege shall be ignored. Some of the

this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. If the implementation does
not support those bits, they may be ignored.
.PP
The
.I uid and 
.I gid 
fields are the user and group ID of the owner and
group of the file, respectively.
.PP
The 
.I size 
field is the size of the file in octets. If the 
.I typeflag
field is set to specify a file to be of type 1 (a link) or 2 (a
symbolic link), the 
.I size 
field shall be specified as zero. If the
.I typeflag 
field is set to specify a file of type 5 (directory), the
size field shall be interpreted as described under the definition
of that record type. No data logical records are stored for types
1, 2, or 5. If the typeflag field is set to 3 (character special
file), 4 (block special file), or 6 (FIFO), the meaning of the
.I size 
field is unspecified by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001,
and no data logical records shall be stored on the medium.
Additionally, for type 6, the 
.I size 
field shall be ignored when
reading. If the 
.I typeflag 
field is set to any other value, the
number of logical records written following the header shall be
(size+511)/512, ignoring any fraction in the result of the
division.
.PP
The
.I mtime 
field shall be the modification time of the file at the
time it was archived. It is the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard
representation of the octal value of the modification time
obtained from the 
.BR stat (2)
function.
.PP
The
.I chksum 
field shall be the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard IRV
representation of the octal value of the simple sum of all octets
in the header logical record. Each octet in the header shall be
treated as an unsigned value. These values shall be added to an
unsigned integer, initialized to zero, the precision of which is
not less than 17 bits. When calculating the checksum, the 
.I chksum
field is treated as if it were all spaces.
.PP
The 
.I typeflag 
field specifies the type of file archived. If a
particular implementation does not recognize the type, or the user
does not have appropriate privilege to create that type, the file
shall be extracted as if it were a regular file if the file type
is defined to have a meaning for the 
.I size 
field that could cause
data logical records to be written on the medium (see the previous
description for 
.IR size ).
If conversion to a regular file occurs, the
.B pax 
utility shall produce an error indicating that the conversion
took place. All of the 
.I typeflag 
fields shall be coded in the
ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard IRV:
.TP
.B 0
Represents a regular file. For backwards-compatibility, a
.I typeflag
value of binary zero ('\e0') should be recognized
as meaning a regular file when extracting files from the
archive. Archives written with this version of the archive
file format create regular files with a 
.I typefla
value of the
ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard IRV '0'.
.TP
.B 1
Represents a file linked to another file, of any type,
previously archived. Such files are identified by having the
same device and file serial numbers, and pathnames that refer
to different directory entries. All such files shall be
archived as linked files. The linked-to name is specified in
the 
.I linkname 
field with a NUL-character terminator if it is
less than 100 octets in length.
.TP
.B 2
Represents a symbolic link. The contents of the symbolic link
shall be stored in the 
.I linkname 
field.
.TP
.B 3,4 
Represent character special files and block special files
respectively. In this case the 
.I devmajor 
and 
.I devminor 
fields
shall contain information defining the device, the format of
which is unspecified by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.
Implementations may map the device specifications to their
own local specification or may ignore the entry.
.TP
.B 5
Specifies a directory or subdirectory. On systems where disk
allocation is performed on a directory basis, the 
.I size 
field
shall contain the maximum number of octets (which may be
rounded to the nearest disk block allocation unit) that the
directory may hold. A 
.I size 
field of zero indicates no such
limiting. Systems that do not support limiting in this manner
should ignore the 
.I size 
field.
.TP
.B 6
Specifies a FIFO special file. Note that the archiving of a
FIFO file archives the existence of this file and not its
contents.
.TP
.B 7
Reserved to represent a file to which an implementation has
associated some high-performance attribute. Implementations
without such extensions should treat this file as a regular
file (type 0).
.TP
.B A\-Z
The letters 'A' to 'Z', inclusive, are reserved for custom
implementations. All other values are reserved for future
versions of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.
.PP
It is unspecified whether files with pathnames that refer to the
same directory entry are archived as linked files or as separate
files. If they are archived as linked files, this means that
attempting to extract both pathnames from the resulting archive
will always cause an error (unless the 
.B \-u 
option is used) because
the link cannot be created.
.PP
It is unspecified whether files with the same device and file
serial numbers being appended to an archive are treated as linked
files to members that were in the archive before the append.
.PP
Attempts to archive a socket using 
.B ustar
interchange format shall
produce a diagnostic message. Handling of other file types is
implementation-defined.
.PP
The 
.I magic 
field is the specification that this archive was output
in this archive format. If this field contains 
.B ustar 
(the five
characters from the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard IRV shown followed
by NUL), the 
.I uname 
and 
.I gname 
fields shall contain the
ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard IRV representation of the owner and
group of the file, respectively (truncated to fit, if necessary).
When the file is restored by a privileged, protection-preserving
version of the utility, the user and group databases shall be
scanned for these names. If found, the user and group IDs
contained within these files shall be used rather than the values
contained within the

shall be restored.

If a user does not have appropriate privilege to set a
particular mode flag, the flag shall be ignored. Some of the
mode flags in the archive format are not mentioned elsewhere
in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. If the implementation
does not support those flags, they may be ignored.

.SS "cpio Special Entries"

FIFO special files, directories, and the trailer shall be recorded
with

for the next file entry in the archive shall be written directly
after the last octet of the file entry preceding it. A header
denoting the filename 
.B "TRAILER!!!"

following such a header are undefined.

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.PP
The following exit values shall be returned:

All files were processed successfully.

.B >0
An error occurred.

.SH "CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS"
.PP
If 
.B pax 
cannot create a file or a link when reading an archive or
cannot find a file when writing an archive, or cannot preserve the
user ID, group ID, or file mode when the 
.B \-p 
option is specified, a
diagnostic message shall be written to standard error and a
non-zero exit status shall be returned, but processing shall
continue. In the case where 
.B pax 
cannot create a link to a file,
.B pax 
shall not, by default, create a second copy of the file.
.PP
If the extraction of a file from an archive is prematurely
terminated by a signal or error, 
.B pax 
may have only partially
extracted the file or (if the 
.B \-n 
option was not specified) may
have extracted a file of the same name as that specified by the
user, but which is not the file the user wanted. Additionally, the
file modes of extracted directories may have additional bits from
the S_IRWXU mask set as well as incorrect modification and access
times.

.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
.PP
Caution is advised when using the 
.B \-a 
option to append to a 
.I cpio
format archive. If any of the files being appended happen to be
given the same 
.I c_dev 
and 
.I c_ino 
values as a file in the existing
part of the archive, then they may be treated as links to that
file on extraction. Thus, it is risky to use 
.B \-a 
with 
.I cpio 
format
except when it is done on the same system that the original
archive was created on, and with the same 
.B pax 
utility, and in the
knowledge that there has been little or no file system activity
since the original archive was created that could lead to any of
the files appended being given the same 
.I c_dev 
and 
.I c_ino 
values as
an unrelated file in the existing part of the archive. Also, when
(intentionally) appending additional links to a file in the
existing part of the archive, the 
.I c_nlink 
values in the modified
archive can be smaller than the number of links to the file in the
archive, which may mean that the links are not preserved on
extraction.
.PP
The 
.B \-p 
(privileges) option was invented to reconcile differences
between historical 
.B tar 
and 
.B cpio 
implementations. In particular,
the two utilities use 
.B \-m 
in diametrically opposed ways. The 
.B \-p
option also provides a consistent means of extending the ways in
which future file attributes can be addressed, such as for
enhanced security systems or high-performance files. Although it
may seem complex, there are really two modes that are most
commonly used:
.TP
.B \-p e
"Preserve everything". This would be used by the historical
superuser, someone with all the appropriate privileges, to
preserve all aspects of the files as they are recorded in the
archive. The 
.B e 
flag is the sum of 
.B o 
and 
.BR p ,
and other implementation-defined attributes.
.TP
.B \-p p
"Preserve" the file mode bits. This would be used by the
user with regular privileges who wished to preserve aspects
of the file other than the ownership. The file times are
preserved by default, but two other flags are offered to
disable these and use the time of extraction.
.PP
The one pathname per line format of standard input precludes
pathnames containing <newline>s. Although such pathnames violate
the portable filename guidelines, they may exist and their
presence may inhibit usage of 
.B pax 
within shell scripts. This
problem is inherited from historical archive programs. The problem
can be avoided by listing filename arguments on the command line
instead of on standard input.
.PP
It is almost certain that appropriate privileges are required for
.B pax 
to accomplish parts of this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.
Specifically, creating files of type block special or character
special, restoring file access times unless the files are owned by
the user (the 
.B \-t 
option), or preserving file owner, group, and
mode (the 
.B \-p 
option) all probably require appropriate privileges.
.PP
In 
.B read 
mode, implementations are permitted to overwrite files
when the archive has multiple members with the same name. This may
fail if permissions on the first version of the file do not permit
it to be overwritten.
.PP
The 
.B cpio 
and 
.B ustar 
formats can only support files up to 8589934592
bytes (8 * 2^30) in size.

.SH EXAMPLES

.SH RATIONALE
.PP
The 
.B pax
utility was new for the ISO POSIX-2:1993 standard. It
represents a peaceful compromise between advocates of the
historical 
.B tar 
and 
.B cpio 
utilities.
.PP
A fundamental difference between 
.B cpio 
and 
.B tar 
was in the way
directories were treated. The 
.B cpio 
utility did not treat
directories differently from other files, and to select a
directory and its contents required that each file in the
hierarchy be explicitly specified. For 
.BR tar ,
a directory matched
every file in the file hierarchy it rooted.
.PP
The
.B pax 
utility offers both interfaces; by default, directories
map into the file hierarchy they root. The 
.B \-d 
option causes 
.B pax 
to
skip any file not explicitly referenced, as 
.I cpio 
historically did.
The 
.B tar 
- style behavior was chosen as the default because it was
believed that this was the more common usage and because 
.B tar 
is
the more commonly available interface, as it was historically
provided on both System V and BSD implementations.
.PP
The data interchange format specification in this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires that processes with "appropriate
privileges" shall always restore the ownership and permissions of
extracted files exactly as archived. If viewed from the historic
equivalence between superuser and "appropriate privileges", there
are two problems with this requirement. First, users running as
superusers may unknowingly set dangerous permissions on extracted
files. Second, it is needlessly limiting, in that superusers
cannot extract files and own them as superuser unless the archive
was created by the superuser. (It should be noted that restoration
of ownerships and permissions for the superuser, by default, is
historical practice in 
.IR cpio ,
but not in 
.BR tar .)
In order to avoid
these two problems, the 
.I pax 
specification has an additional
"privilege" mechanism, the 
.B \-p 
option. Only a 
.B pax 
invocation with
the privileges needed, and which has the 
.B \-p 
option set using the 
.B e
specification character, has the "appropriate privilege" to
restore full ownership and permission information.
.PP
Note also that this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 requires that
the file ownership and access permissions shall be set, on
extraction, in the same fashion as the 
.BR creat (2)
function when
provided with the mode stored in the archive. This means that the
file creation mask of the user is applied to the file permissions.
.PP
Users should note that directories may be created by 
.B pax 
while
extracting files with permissions that are different from those
that existed at the time the archive was created. When extracting
sensitive information into a directory hierarchy that no longer
exists, users are encouraged to set their file creation mask
appropriately to protect these files during extraction.
.PP
The table of contents output is written to standard output to
facilitate pipeline processing.
.PP
An early proposal had hard links displaying for all pathnames.
This was removed because it complicates the output of the case
where 
.B \-v 
is not specified and does not match historical 
.B cpio
usage. The hard-link information is available in the 
.B \-v 
display.
.PP
The description of the 
.B \-l 
option allows implementations to make
hard links to symbolic links. IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not
specify any way to create a hard link to a symbolic link, but many
implementations provide this capability as an extension. If there
are hard links to symbolic links when an archive is created, the
implementation is required to archive the hard link in the archive
(unless 
.B \-H 
or 
.B \-L 
is specified). When in 
.B read 
mode and in 
.B copy
mode, implementations supporting hard links to symbolic links
should use them when appropriate.
.PP
The archive formats inherited from the POSIX.1-1990 standard have
certain restrictions that have been brought along from historical
usage. For example, there are restrictions on the length of
pathnames stored in the archive. When 
.B pax is used in 
.BR copy " (" \-rw )
mode (copying directory hierarchies), the ability to use
extensions from the 
.BI \-x " pax"
format overcomes these restrictions.
.PP
The default blocksize value of 5120 bytes for 
.B cpio 
was selected
because it is one of the standard block-size values for 
.BR cpio ,
set
when the 
.B \-B 
option is specified. (The other default block-size
value for 
.B cpio 
is 512 bytes, and this was considered to be too
small.) The default block value of 10240 bytes for 
.B tar 
was selected because that is the standard block-size value for BSD
.BR tar .
The maximum block size of 32256 bytes (2^15-512 bytes) is the
largest multiple of 512 bytes that fits into a signed 16-bit tape
controller transfer register. There are known limitations in some
historical systems that would prevent larger blocks from being
accepted. Historical values were chosen to improve compatibility
with historical scripts using
.BR dd (1)
or similar utilities to
manipulate archives. Also, default block sizes for any file type
other than character special file has been deleted from this
volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 as unimportant and not likely to
affect the structure of the resulting archive.
.PP
Implementations are permitted to modify the block-size value based
on the archive format or the device to which the archive is being
written. This is to provide implementations with the opportunity
to take advantage of special types of devices, and it should not
be used without a great deal of consideration as it almost
certainly decreases archive portability.
.PP
The intended use of the 
.B \-n 
option was to permit extraction of one
or more files from the archive without processing the entire
archive. This was viewed by the standard developers as offering
significant performance advantages over historical
implementations. The 
.B \-n 
option in early proposals had three
effects; the first was to cause special characters in patterns to
not be treated specially. The second was to cause only the first
file that matched a pattern to be extracted. The third was to
cause 
.B pax 
to write a diagnostic message to standard error when no
file was found matching a specified pattern. Only the second
behavior is retained by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, for
many reasons. First, it is in general not acceptable for a single
option to have multiple effects. Second, the ability to make
pattern matching characters act as normal characters is useful for
parts of
.B pax
other than file extraction. Third, a finer degree of
control over the special characters is useful because users may
wish to normalize only a single special character in a single
filename. Fourth, given a more general escape mechanism, the
previous behavior of the 
.B \-n 
option can be easily obtained using
the 
.B \-s 
option or a sed script. Finally, writing a diagnostic
message when a pattern specified by the user is unmatched by any
file is useful behavior in all cases.
.PP
In this version, the 
.B \-n 
was removed from the copy mode synopsis of
.BR pax ;
it is inapplicable because there are no pattern operands
specified in this mode.
.PP
There is another method than 
.B pax 
for copying subtrees in
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 described as part of the 
.BR cp (1)
utility. Both
methods are historical practice: 
.BR cp (1)
provides a simpler, more
intuitive interface, while 
.B pax 
offers a finer granularity of
control. Each provides additional functionality to the other; in
particular, 
.B pax 
maintains the hard-link structure of the hierarchy
while 
.BR cp (1)
does not. It is the intention of the standard developers
that the results be similar (using appropriate option combinations
in both utilities). The results are not required to be identical;
there seemed insufficient gain to applications to balance the
difficulty of implementations having to guarantee that the results
would be exactly identical.
.PP
A single archive may span more than one file. It is suggested that
implementations provide informative messages to the user on
standard error whenever the archive file is changed.
.PP
The 
.B \-d 
option (do not create intermediate directories not listed
in the archive) found in early proposals was originally provided
as a complement to the historic 
.B \-d 
option of 
.BR cpio .
It has been deleted.
.PP
The 
.B \-s 
option in early proposals specified a subset of the
substitution command from the ed utility. As there was no reason
for only a subset to be supported, the 
.B \-s 
option is now compatible
with the current ed specification. Since the delimiter can be any
non-null character, the following usage with single spaces is
valid:
.PP
.B
     pax \-s " foo bar " .\|.\|.
.PP
The 
.B \-t description is worded so as to note that this may cause the
access time update caused by some other activity (which occurs
while the file is being read) to be overwritten.
.PP
The default behavior of 
.B pax 
with regard to file modification times
is the same as historical implementations of 
.BR tar .
It is not the
historical behavior of 
.BR cpio .
.PP
Because the 
.B \-i 
option uses 
.BR /dev/tty ,
utilities without a
controlling terminal are not able to use this option.
.PP
The 
.B \-y 
option, found in early proposals, has been deleted because
a line containing a single period for the 
.B \-i 
option has equivalent
functionality. The special lines for the 
.B \-i 
option (a single
period and the empty line) are historical practice in 
.BR cpio .
.PP
In early drafts, a 
.BI \-e " charmap"
option was included to increase
portability of files between systems using different coded
character sets. This option was omitted because it was apparent
that consensus could not be formed for it. In this version, the
use of UTF-8 should be an adequate substitute.
.PP
The 
.B \-k 
option was added to address international concerns about
the dangers involved in the character set transformations of 
.B \-e
(if the target character set were different from the source, the
filenames might be transformed into names matching existing files)
and also was made more general to protect files transferred
between file systems with different 
.I {NAME_MAX} 
values (truncating
a filename on a smaller system might also inadvertently overwrite
existing files). As stated, it prevents any overwriting, even if
the target file is older than the source. This version adds more
granularity of options to solve this problem by introducing the 
.BI "\-o invalid=" option
\- specifically the UTF-8 action. (Note that an
existing file that is named with a UTF-8 encoding is still subject
to overwriting in this case. The 
.B \-k 
option closes that loophole.)
.PP
Some of the file characteristics referenced in this volume of
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 might not be supported by some archive
formats. For example, neither the 
.B tar 
nor 
.B cpio 
formats contain the
file access time. For this reason, the 
.B e 
specification character
has been provided, intended to cause all file characteristics
specified in the archive to be retained.
.PP
It is required that extracted directories, by default, have their
access and modification times and permissions set to the values
specified in the archive. This has obvious problems in that the
directories are almost certainly modified after being extracted
and that directory permissions may not permit file creation. One
possible solution is to create directories with the mode specified
in the archive, as modified by the 
.I umask 
of the user, with
sufficient permissions to allow file creation. After all files
have been extracted, 
.B pax 
would then reset the access and
modification times and permissions as necessary.
.PP
The list-mode formatting description borrows heavily from the one
defined by the 
.BR printf (1)
utility. However, since there is no separate
operand list to get conversion arguments, the format was extended
to allow specifying the name of the conversion argument as part of
the conversion specification.
.PP
The
.B T 
conversion specifier allows time fields to be displayed in
any of the date formats. Unlike the 
.BR ls (1)
utility, 
.B pax 
does not
adjust the format when the date is less than six months in the
past. This makes parsing the output more predictable.
.PP
The 
.B D 
conversion specifier handles the ability to display the
major/minor or file size, as with 
.BR ls (1), 
by using %-8(size)D.
.PP
The 
.B L 
conversion specifier handles the ls display for symbolic
links.
.PP
Conversion specifiers were added to generate existing known types
used for 
.BR ls (1).

.SS "pax Interchange Format"
.PP
The new POSIX data interchange format was developed primarily to
satisfy international concerns that the 
.B ustar 
and 
.B cpio 
formats did
not provide for file, user, and group names encoded in characters
outside a subset of the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard. The standard
developers realized that this new POSIX data interchange format
should be very extensible because there were other requirements
they foresaw in the near future:
.TP
.B \(bu
Support international character encodings and locale
information
.TP
.B \(bu
Support security information (ACLs, and so on)
.TP
.B \(bu
Support future file types, such as realtime or contiguous files
.TP
.B \(bu
Include data areas for implementation use
.TP
.B \(bu
Support systems with words larger than 32 bits and timers
with subsecond granularity
.PP
The following were not goals for this format because these are
better handled by separate utilities or are inappropriate for a
portable format:
.TP
.B \(bu
Encryption
.TP
.B \(bu
Compression
.TP
.B \(bu
Data translation between locales and codesets
.TP
.B \(bu
inode storage
.PP
The format chosen to support the goals is an extension of the
.B ustar 
format. Of the two formats previously available, only the
.B ustar 
format was selected for extensions because:
.TP
.B \(bu
It was easier to extend in an upwards-compatible way. It
offered version flags and header block type fields with room
for future standardization. The 
.B cpio 
format, while possessing
a more flexible file naming methodology, could not be
extended without breaking some theoretical implementation or
using a dummy filename that could be a legitimate filename.
.TP
.B \(bu
Industry experience since the original "\fBtar\fP\ wars"
fought in
developing the ISO POSIX-1 standard has clearly been in favor
of the 
.B ustar 
format, which is generally the default output
format selected for 
.B pax 
implementations on new systems.
.PP
The new format was designed with one additional goal in mind:
reasonable behavior when an older 
.B tar 
or 
.B pax 
utility happened to
read an archive. Since the POSIX.1-1990 standard mandated that a
"format-reading utility" had to treat unrecognized 
.I typeflag 
values
as regular files, this allowed the format to include all the
extended information in a pseudo-regular file that preceded each
real file. An option is given that allows the archive creator to
set up reasonable names for these files on the older systems.
Also, the normative text suggests that reasonable file access
values be used for this 
.B ustar 
header block. Making these header
files inaccessible for convenient reading and deleting would not
be reasonable. File permissions of 600 or 700 are suggested.
.PP
The ustar 
.I typeflag 
field was used to accommodate the additional
functionality of the new format rather than 
.I magic 
or 
.I version
because the POSIX.1-1990 standard (and, by reference, the previous
version of 
.BR pax ),
mandated the behavior of the format-reading
utility when it encountered an unknown 
.IR typeflag ,
but was silent about the other two fields.
.PP
Early proposals of the first revision to IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
contained a proposed archive format that was based on
compatibility with the standard for tape files (ISO 1001, similar
to the format used historically on many mainframes and
minicomputers). This format was overly complex and required
considerable overhead in volume and header records. Furthermore,
the standard developers felt that it would not be acceptable to
the community of POSIX developers, so it was later changed to be a
format more closely related to historical practice on POSIX
systems.
.PP
The
.I prefix
and 
.I name 
split of pathnames in 
.B ustar 
was replaced by
the single path extended header record for simplicity.
.PP
The concept of a global extended header 
.RB "(typeflag" " g" )
was
controversial. If this were applied to an archive being recorded
on magnetic tape, a few unreadable blocks at the beginning of the
tape could be a serious problem; a utility attempting to extract
as many files as possible from a damaged archive could lose a
large percentage of file header information in this case. However,
if the archive were on a reliable medium, such as a CD-ROM, the
global extended header offers considerable potential size
reductions by eliminating redundant information. Thus, the text
warns against using the global method for unreliable media and
provides a method for implanting global information in the
extended header for each file, rather than in the
.IB typeflag " g"
records.
.PP
No facility for data translation or filtering on a per-file basis
is included because the standard developers could not invent an
interface that would allow this in an efficient manner. If a
filter, such as encryption or compression, is to be applied to all
the files, it is more efficient to apply the filter to the entire
archive as a single file. The standard developers considered
interfaces that would invoke a shell script for each file going
into or out of the archive, but the system overhead in this
approach was considered to be too high.
.PP
One such approach would be to have 
.B filter= 
records that give a
pathname for an executable. When the program is invoked, the file
and archive would be open for standard input/output and all the
header fields would be available as environment variables or
command-line arguments. The standard developers did discuss such
schemes, but they were omitted from IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 due to
concerns about excessive overhead. Also, the program itself would
need to be in the archive if it were to be used portably.
.PP
There is currently no portable means of identifying the character
set(s) used for a file in the file system. Therefore, 
.B pax 
has not
been given a mechanism to generate charset records automatically.
The only portable means of doing this is for the user to write the
archive using the 
.IR "\-o charset=" string
command line option. This
assumes that all of the files in the archive use the same
encoding. The "implementation-defined" text is included to allow
for a system that can identify the encodings used for each of its
files.
.PP
The table of standards that accompanies the charset record
description is acknowledged to be very limited. Only a limited
number of character set standards is reasonable for maximal
interchange. Any character set is, of course, possible by prior
agreement. It was suggested that EBCDIC be listed, but it was
omitted because it is not defined by a formal standard. Formal
standards, and then only those with reasonably large followings,
can be included here, simply as a matter of practicality. The
.IR <value> s
represent names of officially registered character sets
in the format required by the ISO 2375:1985 standard.
.PP
The normal comma or <blank>-separated list rules are not followed
in the case of keyword options to allow ease of argument parsing
for 
.BR getopts .
.PP
Further information on character encodings is in 
.B pax 
Archive
.BR "Character Set Encoding/Decoding" .
.PP
The standard developers have reserved keyword name space for
vendor extensions. It is suggested that the format to be used is:
.PP
.BI "    VENDOR." keyword
.PP
where 
.B VENDOR 
is the name of the vendor or organization in all
uppercase letters. It is further suggested that the keyword
following the period be named differently than any of the standard
keywords so that it could be used for future standardization, if
appropriate, by omitting the 
.B VENDOR 
prefix.
.PP
The 
.RI < length >
field in the extended header record was included to
make it simpler to step through the records, even if a record
contains an unknown format (to a particular 
.BR pax )
with complex
interactions of special characters. It also provides a minor
integrity checkpoint within the records to aid a program
attempting to recover files from a damaged archive.
.PP
There are no extended header versions of the 
.I devmajor 
and 
.I devminor
fields because the unspecified format 
.B ustar 
header field should be
sufficient. If they are not, vendor-specific extended keywords
(such as 
.BR VENDOR.devmajor )
should be used.
.PP
Device and i-number labeling of files was not adopted from 
.BR cpio ;
files are interchanged strictly on a symbolic name basis, as in
.BR ustar .
.PP
Just as with the 
.B ustar 
format descriptions, the new format makes
no special arrangements for multi-volume archives. Each of the 
.B pax
archive types is assumed to be inside a single POSIX file and
splitting that file over multiple volumes (diskettes, tape
cartridges, and so on), processing their labels, and mounting each
in the proper sequence are considered to be implementation details
that cannot be described portably.
.PP
The 
.B pax 
format is intended for interchange, not only for backup on
a single (family of) systems. It is not as densely packed as might
be possible for backup:
.TP

It contains information as coded characters that could be
coded in binary.
.TP
.B \(bu
It identifies extended records with name fields that could be
omitted in favor of a fixed-field layout.
.TP
.B \(bu
It translates names into a portable character set and
identifies locale-related information, both of which are
probably unnecessary for backup.
.PP
The requirements on restoring from an archive are slightly
different from the historical wording, allowing for non-monolithic
privilege to bring forward as much as possible. In particular,
attributes such as "high performance file" might be broadly but
not universally granted while set-user-ID or 
.BR chown (2)
might be much
more restricted. There is no implication in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001
that the security information be honored after it is restored to
the file hierarchy, in spite of what might be improperly inferred
by the silence on that topic. That is a topic for another
standard.
.PP
Links are recorded in the fashion described here because a link
can be to any file type. It is desirable in general to be able to
restore part of an archive selectively and restore all of those
files completely. If the data is not associated with each link, it
is not possible to do this. However, the data associated with a
file can be large, and when selective restoration is not needed,
this can be a significant burden. The archive is structured so
that files that have no associated data can always be restored by
the name of any link name of any link, and the user may choose
whether data is recorded with each instance of a file that
contains data. The format permits mixing of both types of links in
a single archive; this can be done for special needs, and 
.B pax 
is
expected to interpret such archives on input properly, despite the
fact that there is no 
.B pax 
option that would force this mixed case
on output. (When 
.BI \-o " linkdata"
is used, the output must contain the
duplicate data, but the implementation is free to include it or
omit it when 
.BI \-o " linkdata"
is not used.)
.PP
The time values are included as extended header records for those
implementations needing more than the eleven octal digits allowed
by the 
.B ustar 
format. Portable file timestamps cannot be negative.
If 
.B pax 
encounters a file with a negative timestamp in 
.B copy 
or
.B write 
mode, it can reject the file, substitute a non-negative
timestamp, or generate a non-portable timestamp with a leading
\&'\-'. Even though some implementations can support finer file-time
granularities than seconds, the normative text requires support
only for seconds since the Epoch because the ISO POSIX-1 standard
states them that way. The 
.B ustar 
format includes only 
.IR mtime ;
the
new format adds 
.I atime 
and 
.I ctime 
for symmetry. The atime access
time restored to the file system will be affected by the 
.BI \-p " a"
and
.BI \-p " e"
options. The 
.I ctime 
creation time (actually 
.I inode 
modification
time) is described with "appropriate privilege" so that it can be
ignored when writing to the file system. POSIX does not provide a
portable means to change file creation time. Nothing is intended
to prevent a non-portable implementation of 
.B pax 
from restoring the
value.
.PP
The 
.IR gid ,
.IR size ,
and 
.I uid 
extended header records were included to
allow expansion beyond the sizes specified in the regular 
.B tar
header. New file system architectures are emerging that will
exhaust the 12-digit size field. There are probably not many
systems requiring more than 8 digits for user and group IDs, but
the extended header values were included for completeness,
allowing overrides for all of the decimal values in the 
.B tar
header.
.PP
The standard developers intended to describe the effective results
of 
.B pax 
with regard to file ownerships and permissions;
implementations are not restricted in timing or sequencing the
restoration of such, provided the results are as specified.
.PP
Much of the text describing the extended headers refers to use in
"\fBwrite\fP or \fBcopy\fP modes". The
.B copy
mode references are due to the normative text: "The effect of the copy
shall be as if the copied files were written to an archive file and
then subsequently extracted ...". There is certainly no way to test
whether
.B pax
is
actually generating the extended headers in 
.B copy 
mode, but the
effects must be as if it had.

.SS "pax Archive Character Set Encoding/Decoding"
.PP
There is a need to exchange archives of files between systems of
different native codesets. Filenames, group names, and user names
must be preserved to the fullest extent possible when an archive
is read on the receiving platform. Translation of the contents of
files is not within the scope of the 
.B pax 
utility.
.PP
There will also be the need to represent characters that are not
available on the receiving platform. These unsupported characters
cannot be automatically folded to the local set of characters due
to the chance of collisions. This could result in overwriting
previous extracted files from the archive or pre-existing files on
the system.
.PP
For these reasons, the codeset used to represent characters within
the extended header records of the 
.B pax 
archive must be
sufficiently rich to handle all commonly used character sets. The
fields requiring translation include, at a minimum, filenames,
user names, group names, and link pathnames. Implementations may
wish to have localized extended keywords that use non-portable
characters.
.PP
The standard developers considered the following options:
.TP
.B \(bu
The archive creator specifies the well-defined name of the
source codeset. The receiver must then recognize the codeset
name and perform the appropriate translations to the
destination codeset.
.TP
.B \(bu
The archive creator includes within the archive the character
mapping table for the source codeset used to encode extended
header records. The receiver must then read the character
mapping table and perform the appropriate translations to the
destination codeset.
.TP
.B \(bu
The archive creator translates the extended header records in
the source codeset into a canonical form. The receiver must
then perform the appropriate translations to the destination
codeset.
.PP
The approach that incorporates the name of the source codeset
poses the problem of codeset name registration, and makes the
archive useless to 
.B pax 
archive decoders that do not recognize that
codeset.
.PP
Because parts of an archive may be corrupted, the standard
developers felt that including the character map of the source
codeset was too fragile. The loss of this one key component could
result in making the entire archive useless. (The difference
between this and the global extended header decision was that the
latter has a workaround-duplicating extended header records on
unreliable media-but this would be too burdensome for large
character set maps.)
.PP
Both of the above approaches also put an undue burden on the 
.B pax
archive receiver to handle the cross-product of all source and
destination codesets.
.PP
To simplify the translation from the source codeset to the
canonical form and from the canonical form to the destination
codeset, the standard developers decided that the internal
representation should be a stateless encoding. A stateless
encoding is one where each codepoint has the same meaning, without
regard to the decoder being in a specific state. An example of a
stateful encoding would be the Japanese Shift-JIS; an example of a
stateless encoding would be the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard
(equivalent to 7-bit ASCII).
.PP
For these reasons, the standard developers decided to adopt a
canonical format for the representation of file information
strings. The obvious, well-endorsed candidate is the
ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 standard (based in part on Unicode), which
can be used to represent the characters of virtually all
standardized character sets. The standard developers initially
agreed upon using UCS2 (16-bit Unicode) as the internal
representation. This repertoire of characters provides a
sufficiently rich set to represent all commonly-used codesets.
.PP
However, the standard developers found that the 16-bit Unicode
representation had some problems. It forced the issue of
standardizing byte ordering. The 2-byte length of each character
made the extended header records twice as long for the case of
strings coded entirely from historical 7-bit ASCII. For these
reasons, the standard developers chose the UTF-8 defined in the
ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 standard. This multi-byte representation
encodes UCS2 or UCS4 characters reliably and deterministically,
eliminating the need for a canonical byte ordering. In addition,
NUL octets and other characters possibly confusing to POSIX file
systems do not appear, except to represent themselves. It was
realized that certain national codesets take up more space after
the encoding, due to their placement within the UCS range; it was
felt that the usefulness of the encoding of the names outweighs
the disadvantage of size increase for file, user, and group names.
.PP
.sp
.ne 10
The encoding of UTF-8 is as follows:
.PP
.TS
lb lb

UCS4 Hex Encoding	UTF-8 Binary Encoding
00000000-0000007F	0xxxxxxx

where each '\fIx\fP' represents a bit value from the character being
translated.

.SS "ustar Interchange Format"
.PP
The description of the 
.B ustar 
format reflects numerous enhancements
over pre-1988 versions of the historical 
.B tar 
utility. The goal of
these changes was not only to provide the functional enhancements
desired, but also to retain compatibility between new and old
versions. This compatibility has been retained. Archives written
using the old archive format are compatible with the new format.
.PP
Implementors should be aware that the previous file format did not
include a mechanism to archive directory type files. For this
reason, the convention of using a filename ending with slash was
adopted to specify a directory on the archive.
.PP
The total size of the 
.I name 
and 
.I prefix 
fields have been set to meet
the minimum requirements for 
.IR {PATH_MAX} 
If a pathname will fit
within the 
.I name 
field, it is recommended that the pathname be
stored there without the use of the 
.I prefix 
field. Although the
name field is known to be too small to contain 
.I {PATH_MAX}
characters, the value was not changed in this version of the
archive file format to retain backwards-compatibility, and instead
the
.I prefix 
was introduced. Also, because of the earlier version of
the format, there is no way to remove the restriction on the
.I linkname 
field being limited in size to just that of the 
.I name
field.
.PP
The 
.I size 
field is required to be meaningful in all implementation
extensions, although it could be zero. This is required so that
the data blocks can always be properly counted.
.PP
It is suggested that if device special files need to be
represented that cannot be represented in the standard format,
that one of the extension types
.RB ( A \- Z )
be used, and that the
additional information for the special file be represented as data
and be reflected in the 
.I size 
field.
.PP
Attempting to restore a special file type, where it is converted
to ordinary data and conflicts with an existing filename, need not
be specially detected by the utility. If run as an ordinary user,
.B pax 
should not be able to overwrite the entries in, for example,
.B /dev 
in any case (whether the file is converted to another type or
not). If run as a privileged user, it should be able to do so, and
it would be considered a bug if it did not. The same is true of
ordinary data files and similarly named special files; it is
impossible to anticipate the needs of the user (who could really
intend to overwrite the file), so the behavior should be
predictable (and thus regular) and rely on the protection system
as required.
.PP
The value 
.B 7 
in the 
.I typeflag 
field is intended to define how
contiguous files can be stored in a 
.B ustar 
archive.
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 does not require the contiguous file
extension, but does define a standard way of archiving such files
so that all conforming systems can interpret these file types in a
meaningful and consistent manner. On a system that does not
support extended file types, the 
.B pax 
utility should do the best it
can with the file and go on to the next.
.PP
The file protection modes are those conventionally used by the 
.BR ls (1)
utility. This is extended beyond the usage in the ISO POSIX-2
standard to support the "shared text" or "sticky" bit. It is
intended that the conformance document should not document
anything beyond the existence of and support of such a mode.
Further extensions are expected to these bits, particularly with
overloading the set-user-ID and set-group-ID flags.

.SS "cpio Interchange Format"
.PP
The reference to appropriate privilege in the 
.B cpio 
format refers
to an error on standard output; the 
.B ustar 
format does not make
comparable statements.
.PP
The model for this format was the historical System V 
.B "cpio \-c"
data
interchange format. This model documents the portable version of
the 
.B cpio 
format and not the binary version. It has the flexibility
to transfer data of any type described within
IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, yet is extensible to transfer data types
specific to extensions beyond IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 (for example,
contiguous files). Because it describes existing practice, there
is no question of maintaining upwards-compatibility.

.SS "cpio Header"
.PP
There has been some concern that the size of the 
.I c_ino 
field of
the header is too small to handle those systems that have very
large inode numbers. However, the 
.I c_ino 
field in the header is
used strictly as a hard-link resolution mechanism for archives. It
is not necessarily the same value as the inode number of the file
in the location from which that file is extracted.
.PP
The name 
.I c_magic 
is based on historical usage.

.SS "cpio Filename"
.PP
For most historical implementations of the 
.B cpio 
utility,
.I {PATH_MAX} 
octets can be used to describe the pathname without the
addition of any other header fields (the NUL character would be
included in this count). 
.I {PATH_MAX} 
is the minimum value for
pathname size, documented as 256 bytes. However, an implementation
may use 
.I c_namesize 
to determine the exact length of the pathname.
With the current description of the 
.B <cpio.h> 
header, this pathname
size can be as large as a number that is described in six octal
digits.
.PP
Two values are documented under the 
.I c_mode
field values to provide
for extensibility for known file types:
.TP
.B "0110 000"
Reserved for contiguous files. The implementation may treat
the rest of the information for this archive like a regular
file. If this file type is undefined, the implementation may
create the file as a regular file.
.PP
This provides for extensibility of the 
.B cpio 
format while allowing
for the ability to read old archives. Files of an unknown type may
be read as "regular files" on some implementations. On a system
that does not support extended file types, the 
.B pax 
utility should
do the best it can with the file and go on to the next.
