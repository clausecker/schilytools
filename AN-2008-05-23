New features with AN-2008-05-23:

-	Several fixes for the Blastwave compile (smake -f Mcsw):

	-	CSWcdrtools now depends on CSWpxupgrade, this allows
		to either use a dummy (source) package for CSWpxupgrade
		or the binary original package that is under NDA.

	-	smake now compiles without /opt/csw/ string in the binary
		this makes smake100% relocatable.

	-	The sccs package is now a non-relocatable packet
		because of /$INS_BASE/ccs/bin/* and because of 
		$INS_BASE/ccs/lib/locale/

	-	RULES/rules.csw now supports to create non-relocatable
		packets by adding PKG_RELOC=no to the leaf Makefile

-	Added an autoconf test for SIZEOF_FLOAT & SIZEOF_DOUBLE to allow
	to compile the Bourne shell in 64 bit mode.

-	The Bourne shell now compiles in 64 bit mode (call "smake CCOM=cc64").

-	mkisofs now prints more explicit error messages if the strings (like
	e.g. the volume name) inside the PVD do not fit. This should help
	people that 	use e.g. UTF-8 based locales and don't understand
	that the strings may use up more octett space than the number of
	characters in the string.

-	mkisofs now supports to import multi-extent files (> 4 GB) from old
	sessions.
