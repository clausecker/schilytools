New features with AN-2019-11-11:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a newer smake
	*** to compile this source. If your smake is too old and aborts, ensure to
	*** use the recent smake by calling:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4
	The recent smake version is smake-1.3

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2018-01-26 introduced
	*** optimizations for the Schily version of SunPro Make, you
	*** need at least the dmake version from 2018/01/11 with support
	*** for the "export" directive to compile with this makefile system.


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	BUG WARNING: Please never report bugs only to Linux distributions as
		they usually do not forward these bug reports upstream and as
		the Linux distributions typically do not let skilled people
		check the bugs. We did not hear about a FIFO problem in star
		for a long time. Then a problem on Linux occurred once
		every 6000-10000 tries but it did not happen on Solaris after
		even 10 million tries, so it was not known besides Linux.


-	include/schily/wchar.h: The new oder of definitions introduced for
	Ultrix support caused WEOF to be missing on Ultrix and as a result,
	diff did not compile anymore.

-	A new method has been introduced to disable the compilation of
	shared libraries on platforms (like Ultrix) where support for
	shared libraries is mising.

-	The files DEFAULTS/Defaults.ultrix and DEFAULTS_ENG/Defaults.ultrix
	now contain a line:

		SHLIB_BUILD=    $(NUMBER_SIGN)

	to switch off compilation for shared libraries on Ultrix.

	to compile on Ultrix, call:

	smake
	cd sunpro
	smake CPPOPTX=-I/usr/local/lib/gcc-lib/mips-dec-ultrix4.4/2.7.2/include/cxx/ 

	You may need to call psmake/smake if you did not yet compile and install
	schilytools on Ultrix.

-	libschily: the new functions wcastoi wcastol wcastolb that have been
	added with the previous release have been forgotten in the linker map
	file.

-	libschily: The man pages for the getargs() option parser that has been
	modeled after a concept Fom UNOS from Charles River Data Systems from
	1980 have been reworked. This includes new man pages getarginit.3
	getvargs.3 getvallargs.3 getvfiles.3 getlargs.3 getlallargs.3
	getlfiles.3 getargerror.3

-	libgetopt: The man page has been reworked and now mentions that the
	long option in the form "-long" first appeared on Multics, then on UNIX
	and both before th GNU type long options.

	Options in the form "--long" have been unknown before they have been
	introduced by GNU around 1990.

-	libgetopt: The file clip.pdf has been added. It explains that the GNU
	style function interface "getopt_long()" is not suitable as general
	interface since it cannot be used together with the shell "getopts(1)"
	builtin command. The PDF has been written by Joseph Kowalski from Sun
	Microsystems. It shows how architectural decisions have been made at
	Sun.

	The concept in this PDF is still not really useful as it claims to
	enforce POSIX rules but at the same time supports GNU style long
	options by default.

	Our enhanced version keeps compatibility to the last OpenSolaris
	version of getopt() but supports what people like. This includes

	-	long options without a short equivalent, since long
		options are used for commands that need more options than
		possible with short options

	-	Multics/UNIX style long options with a single dash that
		are in use on UNIX since approx. 1980.

	Note that while the current getopt() supports all basic features that
	are used in modern programs, it is recommended to use the

		getargs()/getfiles()

	type suite from libschily if there is a need to support more than basic
	features. The getargs()/getfiles() type functions allow to control the
	behavior more fine grained.

-	libgetopt: The function getsubopt() from POSIX has been added

-	libgetopt: The man page for getsubopt() has been added

-	star: When using star -copy, the default is now -no-secure-links.
	This is what users like since they are copying their own data that
	per definition cannot be untrusted external data.

-	star: star -diff is now "more smooth" to use, when the archive type
	is GNU TAR and the "atime" or "ctime" properties are not present
	for a specific file. Before, Jan 1 1970 was the assumed time in
	the archive.

-	star: star -diff now prints a diff statistics summary.

-	star: New version date

-	mkisofs: added TODO file update that includes local modifications
	from up to 2008

-	SCCS: fixed a typo in diff.c

	Thanks to Robert Clausecker for reporting

-	SCCS: Added a new delta type 'U' that allows to tell get(1) to remove
	the g-file. Such SCCS history files are going to be used as
	placeholders for removed files in the upcomming project mode.

	If a file under control is renamed, it's history file is renamed as
	well.

	If a file under control is removed, it's history file is renamed to the
	directory $PROJECTHOME/.sccs/dels/SCCS and a new "unlink" type history
	file is installed under the old name.

	This is important, as it will allow to resync repository copies
	using tar. This also works for mercurial based repositories but not for
	git repositories that did run "git gc" before.

-	SCCS: admin now has a new option -Xunlink. It can be used together with
	-n to create special SCCS history files that remove the g-file on
	extraction if a delta is to be extracted that is of type 'U'.

-	SCCS: get now honors delta table entries that use the new 'U' delta
	type and removed non-writable g-files on extraction. This feature only
	works if the history file is in SCCS V6 mode.

-	SCCS: the help file "cmds" now mentions the new option -Xunlink

-	SCCS: The man page for sccsfile.4 nowmentions the new Delta Table
	Type 'U'.

-	SCCS: The man page for "changeset.4" has been reworded to increase
	reeadablility and it fixed a typo that claimed that the changeset
	file uses six instead of five fields per entry.

-	SCCS: conpliance tests: the y2000 test suite now exptects a 32 bit
	"prs" binary to fail with year 3000.

-	SCCS: The makefile changesetman.mk now localizes the content
	
		.so man4/sccschangeset.4

	To make it .so man5/sccschangeset.5 on Linux.

-	SCCS a new option -Xmail=address allows admin(1) and delta(1) to add
	an email address to the delta meta data.

-	SCCS: New version date

-	SunPro Make: The Makefile in sunpro/Make now makes use of the 
	new construct $(SHLIB_BUILD)DIRS to exclude libmakestate on
	Ultrix as Ultrix does not suppport shared libraries.

-	SunPro Make: The -C option that has been recently been introduced was
	processed too late (after ".make.rules" may have been read).

	The -C option is now handled ealier (before searching for .make.rules),
	to use the correct local default rules in case they exist.

-	SunPro Make: The check for -C dir in MAKEFLAGS has been improved.
	The previous implementation did catch and suppress -C dir but not 
	-Cdir.
	



-	SCCS TODO:

	-	Convert sccs.c to use -NSCCS in the back end programs instead
		of converting g-file names from the command line into s.file
		names in the frontend in order to forward s.file names to the
		backend programs. Doing it this way allows us to have the SCCS
		history files "off tree" in a separate directory tree starting
		with ".sccs/" at the "project root" directory, as the related
		code to convert path names is in libcomobj::bulkprepare().

	-	Add code to admin(1) and delta(1) to retrieve the list of
		new or modified files in order to have all important code
		for a "sccs commit" in a single program that does not need to
		deal with ARG_MAX limitations.

	-	Add code to admin(1), delta(1) and get(1) to maintain/understand
		the changeset file.

	-	Add code to libcomobj to understand the changeset file,
		which is needed in order to e.g. know the file names and file
		specific SIDs/state that correspond to a project global SID.

	-	Add code to all programs to maintain a lock (for the file
		$PROJECTHOME/.sccs/SCCS/s.changeset, that would be in the file
		$PROJECTHOME/.sccs/SCCS/z.changeset) to maintain a project
		global lock.

	-	Find/verify a complete transactional model that allows to repair
		complex changes to the set of files for a project that have
		been aborted in the middle. The current idea is to create the
		file $PROJECTHOME/.sccs/changeset with the deltas to the
		changeset during a complex update operation.

	-	Find a way to decide when to use SCCS v6 type history files.

		For the project mode, this is needed in order to prevent 
		historic SCCS implementations to believe they could modify
		files without knowing about project global locks.

		Currently, SCCS V67 needs to be anebale manually for every
		history file using "admin".





-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.

-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
