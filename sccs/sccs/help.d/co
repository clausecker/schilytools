-1
"not an SCCS file"
A file that you think is an SCCS file
does not begin with the characters "s.".
-2
"not an sccs file"
A file that you think is an SCCS file
does not begin with the magic ^Ahnnnnn (SCCS v4) or ^AhV6,sum=nnnnn (SCCS v6)
in it's first line.
-3
"more than one link"
SCCS files may only have one name (link).
This is because the delta program unlinks the old file
and then links to the new file.
-4
"format error at line ..."
The format of the SCCS file is logically invalid.  The error
was discovered at the stated line.  See if you can find
the problem with the prs command.  If not, do a "help stuck".
-5
"premature eof"
The SCCS file ended in a strange place.  Its probably a goner.
You can try "help stuck", but chances are you're going to
have to go to a backup copy.
-6
"corrupted file"
The computed global hash count of the input SCCS history file did not check
with the stored hash count.  The file may have been damaged since it was
last accessed.  See your local SCCS maintenance person.
-7
"too long"
The pathname is too long.
-8
"invalid sid"
The specified sid is syntactically incorrect.
-10
"clock set wrong!!!"
The time of day is wrong.  Contact your local UNIX support group immediately!
(Try a "date" command.)
(This error is produced whenever the creation date of the newest delta
in the SCCS file is newer than the current date.  This will happen
whenever the date is accidently set wrong.  This error
will also occur if a delta was created while the clock was
set ahead - but less than a year - and has since been corrected.
In this case the current time is correct, but the date of the
delta is wrong.)
-11
"Clock may be set wrong!"
The time of day may be set wrong.
Check the current time with the "date" command.
If it is wrong, contact your local UNIX support group immediately!
(This message is produced whenever the difference between
the current date and the creation date of the newest delta in
the SCCS file is greater than one year.)
-12
"bad range"
In a delta list, the two limits of a range of deltas were not in ascending
order.
-13
"delta list syntax"
A list of deltas was syntatically erroneous.  The correct syntax is:
		<list>	::=  <range> | <list> , <range>
		<range>	::=  <delta> | <delta> - <delta>
		<delta>	::=  <rel> | <rel> . <lev>
-14
"not authorized to make deltas"
Your login name or group ID is not on the list of
users who are allowed to add deltas to this file.
You can execute "prs -d:UN: file" to see who is allowed. 
See your project administrator to get your login name or
group ID on the list.
-15
"release ... < ... (floor)"
Either the release you specified or else the default release is lower
than the lowest allowable release (the floor).  If you're not sure what's
wrong see your SCCS administrator.
-16
"release ... > ... (ceiling)"
Either the release you specified or else the default release is higher
than the highest allowable release (the ceiling).  If you're not sure what's
wrong see your SCCS administrator.
-17
"bad p-file format"
The p-file is messed up.
Get your local source code administrator to
fix it.
-18
"line longer than 1024 characters"
Don't type so much on a line.
-19
"response too long"
A response can't be so long.
Try typing less (maybe you can reference
some other document).
-20
"cannot fork; try again"
The system is busy;
you'll have to try again later.
-21
"too many MRs"
You can't enter so many MRs.
Sorry.
-22
"out of space"
Your MRs took up too much memory.
Type less.
-23
... locked against editing
The specified release (or possibly all releases) for the
SCCS file have been locked using the _l flag of admin.  Do a
'prs -d:LK: s.filename' to see a list of locked releases
(_a means "all").
-24
"MR number too long"
You entered an MR number which is much to long.  Remember,
multiple MRs should be separated by spaces or tabs.
-25
"begins"
An include/exclude conflict exists beginning here.  The
SID's in the include/exclude list change conflicting lines.
The lines involved may not be correct.
-26
"ends"
An include/exclude conflict ends here.  The SID's in the 
include/exclude list change conflicting lines.  The lines
preceding this message may be incorrect.
-27
"corrupted file version"
The computed version specific hash count of the extracted file version did
not check with the stored hash count.  The file may have been damaged
since it was last accessed.  File version hashs are a SCCS v6 extension,
so the problem may have been caused by an incorrect SCCS v4 -> SCCS v6
history file conversion.  You may like to check other versions for correct
checksums to isolate the problem.  See your local SCCS maintenance person.
-28
"path conversion error"
A path could not be converted into a normalized path without
"./" or ".." components and without symbolic links.
-29
"resolved path too long"
The resolved path name is too long for further processing.
-30
"too many include exclude or ignore entries"
The SCCS history file contains more a delta entry with more include,
exclude or ignore entries than expected. Contact the SCCS maintainers
to increase the MAXLINE constant and recompile.
-31
"line too long"
A line in a file was longer than a static buffer. Contact the SCCS maintainers
to increase the MAXLINE constant and recompile.
-32
"cannot get project home directory"
The project set home directory could not be retrieved.
The project set home is a directory that holds a directory
".sccs" for project specific SCCS metadata. The location of this
directory .sccs is searched for by scanning the filesystem
towards the root directory starting from the current working
directory. If an error occurs while trying to look for .sccs,
a sccs program cannot find out whether the current repository
is a project oriented SCCS v6 repository. Check and fix
directory permissions to make sccs work again.
-33
"no SCCS project home directory"
The project set home directory was not seen.
The project set home is a directory that holds a directory
".sccs" for project specific SCCS metadata. The location of this
directory .sccs is searched for by scanning the filesystem
towards the root directory starting from the current working
directory. If the directory ".sccs" or it's default content was
not found, SCCS cannot work in project mode.
Try to run "sccs init" to mark a project home directory.
-34
"bad syntax in changeset line"
A line in the changeset file was incorrectly structured.
Check the changeset file for consistency. Inform your local
SCCS administrator.
-35
"no initial path in data structures"
The SCCS packet structure was not fully initialized. Inform
your local administrator.
