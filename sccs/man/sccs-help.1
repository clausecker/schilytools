.SH NAME
sccs-help, help \- ask for help regarding SCCS error or warning messages
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
.B /usr/ccs/bin/help \c
.RI [ argument ]...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
The
.B help
utility retrieves information to further explain errors messages and warnings
from
.B SCCS
commands. It also provides some information about
.B SCCS
command usage. If no arguments are given,
.B help
prompts for one.

.LP
An
.I argument
may be a message number (which normally appears in parentheses following each
.B SCCS
error or warning message), or an
.B SCCS
command name.
.B help
responds with an explanation of the message or a usage line for the command.

.LP
When the argument is all non-numeric, the text is searched in the file
.BR cmds .
See the section
.B FILES
below for the related base directory.
.LP
When the argument starts with alpha characters and ends in numbers, the
alpha prefix is used as a
.B key
to locate a file.
If the
.I key
is seen in the
.B helploc
file, a new directory prefix is taken from that file, else
it is used as a file name with the standard prefix to search for messages.
The remainder of the argument is used to search a label in the
message file and to print the message text.
.LP
When the argument starts with numbers, or a file related to
.I key
could not be found,
the text is searched in the file
.BR default .

.LP
When all else fails, try
.RB ` "/usr/ccs/bin/help  stuck" '.

.SH AUTHORS
The
.B SCCS
suite was originally written by Marc J. Rochkind at Bell Labs in 1972.
Release 4.0 of
.BR SCCS ,
introducing new versions of the programs
.BR admin (1),
.BR get (1),
.BR prt (1),
and
.BR delta (1)
was published on February 18, 1977; it introduced the new text based
.B SCCS\ v4
history file format (previous
.B SCCS
releases used a binary history file format).
The
.B SCCS
suite
was later maintained by various people at AT&T and Sun Microsystems.
Since 2006, the
.B SCCS
suite is maintained by J\*org Schilling.
