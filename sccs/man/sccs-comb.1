.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
\fBcomb\fR generates a shell script (see 
\fBsh\fR(1))
that you can use to reconstruct the indicated \fBs.\fRfiles.
This script is written to the standard output.
.sp

.LP
If a directory name is used in place of the \fIs.filename\fR argument, the \fBcomb\fR command applies to
all \fBs.\fRfiles in that directory. Unreadable \fBs.\fRfiles produce an error; processing continues with the next file
(if any). The use of `\fB\(mi\fR' as the \fIs.filename\fR argument indicates that the names of files are to be read
from the standard input, one \fBs.\fRfile per line.
.sp

.LP
If no options are specified, \fBcomb\fR preserves only
the most recent (leaf) delta in a branch, and the minimal number of ancestors
needed to preserve the history.
.sp

.SH OPTIONS

.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp

.sp
.ne 2
.TP 13
\fB\fB-o\fR\fR
For each `\fBget \fR\fB-e\fR'
generated, access the reconstructed file at the release of the delta to
be created. Otherwise, the reconstructed file is accessed at the most recent
ancestor. The use of \fB-o\fR may decrease the size of the reconstructed \fBs.\fRfile. It may also alter the shape of the delta tree of the original
file.
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
Generate scripts
to gather statistics, rather than combining deltas. When run, the shell
scripts report: the file name, size (in blocks) after combining, original
size (also in blocks), and the percentage size change, computed by the formula: 
.sp

.sp
100 * ( \fIoriginal\fR\fB \(mi \fR\fIcombined\fR\fB ) / \fR\fIoriginal\fR\fB\fR
.sp

.sp
This option can be used to calculate the space that will be saved,
before actually doing the combining.
.sp

.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-c\fR\fIsid-list\fR\fR
Include the indicated list of deltas.  All other deltas
are omitted. \fIsid-list\fR is a comma-separated list
of \fBSCCS\fR delta \fBIDs\fR (SIDs). To specify a range of deltas, use a `\fB\(mi\fR' separator instead of a comma, between two \fBSIDs\fR in the list.
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-p\fR\fISID\fR\fR
The \fBSID\fR of the oldest delta
to be preserved.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-V
Prints the
.B comb
version number string and exists.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See
.BR environ (5)
for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the
execution of
.BR comb (1):
.BR LANG ,
.BR LC_ALL ,
.BR LC_COLLATE ,
.BR LC_CTYPE ,
.BR LC_MESSAGES ,
and
.BR NLSPATH .
.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B SCCS_NO_HELP
If set,
.BR comb (1)
will not automatically call
.BR help (1)
with the SCCS error code in order to print a more helpful
error message. Scripts that depend on the exact error messages
of SCCS commands should set the environment variable
.B SCCS_NO_HELP
and set
.BR LC_ALL=C .

.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.TP 5
.B 0
Successful completion.
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
.B 1
An error occurred.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.LP
Use the SCCS
.B help
command for explanations (see 
.BR sccs-help (1)).

.SH BUGS
.LP
.B comb
may rearrange the shape of the tree of deltas.
It may not save any space; in fact, it is possible for the reconstructed
file to actually be larger than the original.

.SH AUTHORS
The
.B SCCS
suite was origininally written by Marc J. Rochkind at Bell Labs in 1972.
Release 4.0 of
.BR SCCS ,
introducing new versions of the programs
.BR admin (1),
.BR get (1),
.BR prt (1),
and
.BR delta (1)
was published on February 18, 1977; it introduced the new text based
.B SCCS\ v4
history file format (previous
.B SCCS
releases used a binary history file format).
The
.B SCCS
suite
was later maintained by various people at AT&T and Sun Microsystems.
Since 2006, the
.B SCCS
suite is maintained by J\*org Schilling.
