.SH NAME
sccs-sact, sact \- show editing activity status of an SCCS file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
.B "/usr/ccs/bin/sact \c
.RB [ \-s "] \c
.IR s.filename...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.B sact
utility informs the user of any
.B SCCS
files that are checked out for editing.
.LP
The output for each named file consists of five fields separated by
.B SPACE
characters.
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
.B SID
of a delta that currently exists in the
.B SCCS
file, to which changes will be made to make the new delta
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
.B SID
for the new delta to be created
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Username of the person who has the file checked out for editing.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Date that the version was checked out.
.RE
.RS +4
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Time that the version was checked out.
.RE
.LP
If a directory name is used in place of the
.I s.filename
argument, the
.B sact
command applies to all
.BR s. files
in that directory. Unreadable
.BR s. files
produce an error; processing continues with the next file (if any). The use of
.RB ` \(mi '
as the
.I s.filename
argument indicates that the names of files are to be read from the
standard input, one
.BR s. file
per line.
.SH OPTIONS

.br
.ne 2
.TP
.B \-s
Suppresses the error message when a file is not currently edited.

.br

version number string and exists.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See
.BR environ (5)
for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the
execution of
.BR sact (1):
.BR LANG ,

.BR LC_COLLATE ,
.BR LC_CTYPE ,
.BR LC_MESSAGES ,
and
.BR NLSPATH .

.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B SCCS_NO_HELP
If set,
.BR sact (1)
will not automatically call
.BR help (1)
with the SCCS error code in order to print a more helpful
error message. Scripts that depend on the exact error messages
of SCCS commands should set the environment variable
.B SCCS_NO_HELP
and set
.BR LC_ALL=C .

.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.TP 5
.B 0

.SH AUTHORS
The
.B SCCS
suite was originally written by Marc J. Rochkind at Bell Labs in 1972.
Release 4.0 of
.BR SCCS ,
introducing new versions of the programs
.BR admin (1),
.BR get (1),
.BR prt (1),
and
.BR delta (1)
was published on February 18, 1977; it introduced the new text based
.B SCCS\ v4
history file format (previous
.B SCCS
releases used a binary history file format).
The
.B SCCS
suite
was later maintained by various people at AT&T and Sun Microsystems.
Since 2006, the
.B SCCS
suite is maintained by J\*org Schilling.
