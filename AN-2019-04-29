New features with AN-2019-04-29:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. If your smake is too old and aborts, ensure this
	*** by calling:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4
	The recent smake version is smake-1.3

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-01-26 introduced
	*** optimizations for the Schily version of SunPro Make, you
	*** need at least the dmake version from 2018/01/11 with support
	*** for the "export" directive to compile with this makefile system.


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	BUG WARNING: Please never report bugs to Linux distributions as they
		usually do not forward these bug reports upstream and as the
		Linux distributions typically do not let skilled people check
		the bugs. We did not hear about a FIFO problem in star for a
		long time and since the problem that (on Linux) occurred once
		every 6000-10000 tries did not happen on Solaris after
		10 million tries, it was not known otherwise.

-	Schily.Copyright: several projects have been updated for a
	Copyright 2019

-	libschily/waitid.c & sh/jobs.c: waitid() emulation now returns
	SIGCONT in si_status in case of WIFCONTINUED()

-	libdbgmalloc: A new macro DBG_MALLOC_MARK() allows to mark allocated
	memory from libdbgmalloc with the current filename and line number.

-	libdbgmalloc/bsh: alloc.c now includes a #undef DBG_MALLOC to allow
	to compile everything with

		smake COPTX=-DDBG_MALLOC

-	bsh/bsh.h: psize() from bsh/alloc.c incorretly used a return type of 
	int instead of size_t. The name of the function also has been changed
	to apsize() to avoid a clash with p/p.c and smake/update.c.

-	bsh/bsh.h: some definifions for alloc.c are now prevented in case that
	include/schily/dbgmalloc.h has been included before. This is done to
	avoid clashes.

-	include/schily/dbgmalloc.h: The check for stdio.h was wrong in case that
	include/schily/dbgmalloc.h is included from include/schily/mconfig.h
	that was included from include/schily/stdio.h

	We now use:
			#if defined(_SCHILY_STDIO_H) && defined(EOF)

-	libshedit/bsh/Bourne Shell: The TAB file name expansion now uses a new
	expansion funtion that is not based on pattern matching but on strstr()
	and thus is no longer fooled by file names that contain pattern matching
	meta characters.

-	libparanoia: Added some code that makes it easier to debug a problem
	that may cause core dumps.

-	libparanoia: Many DBG_MALLOC_MARK() calls have been added in order to
	make debugging memory problems easier.

-	libparanoia: The file README.interface has been made up to date to
	match the library release SCHILY_1.1 from December 2013.

-	libshedit: New functions shedit_gpromptidx() and shedit_spromptidx()
	allow to get and set the prompt index separately from the already
	existing interface shedit_setprompts(). This interface is not yet
	used.

-	calc: The program now prints an error message when it is aborted
	with a read error on stdin.

	When compiling with: COPTX=-DFERR_DEBUG is can be used to debug
	jobcontrol problems in shells.

-	cdda2wav: The read Fallback-C2 funcion that tries to read with the
	better Sony SCSI commands did not correctly fall back to the MMC-C2
	read function. This has been fixed by Heiko Eißfeldt.

-	cdda2wav: Some numerical constants have been replaced by names that 
	help to make the code easier readable

-	cdda2wav: avoid a strncpy() for a string to itself in toc.c

-	cdda2wav: The Copyright message for Heiko Eißfeldt now mentions 2019.

-	cdda2wav: The cdda2wav version strings printed on other locations
	than cdda2wav -version now also mention the version date of cdda2wav.

-	readcd: a new option spt=# allows to limit the number of secters
	per transfer for testing purposes.

-	libfind/star: the verbose listing code has ben restructured to have
		the file permissions in the same string as the file type.
		This is needed to implement the POSIX pax listformat interpreter
		format %M in future.

-	libfind/star: the verbose listing no longer prints "l" for mandatory
		record locking for non-directory type file, but rather only
		for plain files.

-	star:	The "gnutar" emulation now prints the --help output to stdout as
		GNU tar does.

-	star:	The gnutar.1 man page now mentions that the GNU tar
		options -g / -G did never work and it thus makes no sense to
		implement them.

-	star: very outdated code in list.c has been removed.

-	star: Added new unit tests for incremental backups and restores.
		This in special include tests that always fail with GNU tar
		as GNU tar is not usable and never was usable for incremental
		restores in case that the differences are more than trivial.

-	star: new version date 2019-04-01

-	Bourne Shell: "trap -- ..." now correctly handles "--" even if the next
	argument is "-".

-	Bourne Shell: trap now supports a new option -p that allows to restore
	the whole trap state using the following commands:

		old_traps=$(trap -p)
		trap "some commands" INT QUIT
		...
		eval "$old_traps"

	This is possible because "trap -p" outputs the state for all signals
	and not only for those signals that are not in the default state.

	The new trap interfase was agreed on in the 2019-04-11 POSIX
	teleconference.

-	Bourne Shell: The exception for "while true; do date; done | uniq -c"
	in job control handling that has been introduced in November 2015 has
	been refined to prevent it from causing "(bosh)" to stop from SIGTTIN.

	Thanks to Robert Elz <kre@munnari.OZ.AU> for reporting.

-	Bourne Shell: A new #define JOB_DEBUG has been added.

-	Bourne Shell: The command:

		(trap '' SEGV; $SHELL -c 'kill -s SEGV $$; echo survived')

	caused the shell not to print "survived" because a previous exception
	for SIGSEGV from the 1977 Bourne Shell version had not been removed
	for the POSIX variant of the shell. The problem occured because it
	was possible to unignore an ignored (at startup) SIGSEGV.

	Thanks to Robert Elz <kre@munnari.OZ.AU> for reporting.

-	Bourne Shell: The code now uses SIG2STR_MAX for the size of the
	sig2str() output buffer.

-	Bourne Shell: the behavior related to SIGINT on the command line
	in the case that the history editor is enabled has been changed to
	match the behavior of ksh. The Bourne Shell now calls trap commands
	for SIGINT when ^C is typed on the command line.

	Note that the classical Bourne Shell behavior (which is still active
	in case the history editor has been disabled via "set +o ved") is that
	the trap command is called after ^C is followed by a CR if both are
	typed on a PS1 prompt.

	Note: The behavior for "trap" in this area is currently not specified
	in POSIX.

-	Bourne Shell: After jobcontrol has been introduced into the Bourne
	Shell: When in jobcontrol mode, the shell could no longer get
	signals at the same time as foreground jobs because when using
	jobcontrol, the shell is in a different process group than the
	foreground job.

	The Bourne Shell now derives the information about a delivered signal
	from the waitid() return data and thus is now able to work the same
	way as it has been designed in 1977. This is the same way as ksh works.

	If a foreground program catches such signals, the shell is still not
	able to detect the signal, but it is now closer to the original
	behavior from 1977.

-	Bourne Shell: new version date 2019-04-17


-	SCCS TODO:

	-	Convert sccs.c to use -NSCCS in the back end programs instead
		of converting g-file names from the command line into s.file
		names in the frontend in order to forward s.file names to the
		backend programs. Doing it this way allows us to have the SCCS
		history files "off tree" in a separate directory tree starting
		with ".sccs/" at the "project root" directory, as the related
		code to convert path names is in libcomobj::bulkprepare().

	-	Add code to admin(1) and delta(1) to retrieve the list of
		new or modified files in order to have all important code
		for a "sccs commit" in a single program that does not need to
		deal with ARG_MAX limitations.

	-	Add code to admin(1), delta(1) and get(1) to maintain/understand
		the changeset file.

	-	Add code to libcomobj to understand the changeset file,
		which is needed in order to e.g. know the file names and file
		specific SIDs/state that correspond to a project global SID.

	-	Add code to all programs to maintain a lock (for the file
		$PROJECTHOME/.sccs/SCCS/s.changeset, that would be in the file
		$PROJECTHOME/.sccs/SCCS/z.changeset) to maintain a project
		global lock.

	-	Find/verify a complete transactional model that allows to repair
		complex changes to the set of files for a project that have
		been aborted in the middle. The current idea is to create the
		file $PROJECTHOME/.sccs/changeset with the deltas to the
		changeset during a complex update operation.

	-	Find a way to decide when to use SCCS v6 type history files.
		For the project mode, this is needed in order to prevent 
		historic SCCS implementations to believe they could modify
		files without knowing about project global locks.





-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.

-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
