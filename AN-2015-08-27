New features with AN-2015-08-27:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	Cdrtools have been bumped to version 3.01-final

-	include/schily/stat.h now includes #define lstat stat in case lstat()
	does not exist on the current platform.

-	include/schily/stat.h now correctly #defines and uses
	S_IFCTG and S_ISCTG instead of the S_IFCNT and S_ISCNT which have
	been erreneously introduced in 1998.

-	mkisofs and star have also been corrected to use
	S_IFCTG and S_ISCTG instead of the S_IFCNT and S_ISCNT

-	libfind: a final workaround for the problems with vfork() in the linux
	system include files has been introduced and a variable has been declared
	volatile.

-	bsh: A bug in the "for" loop parser was fixed. That bug caused an endless
	parsing loop with bsh -c '...'. Thanks to a report for Stephane Chazelas.

-	Bourne Shell: the computation of th CPU percentage now uses a long long
	if possible and thus allows to compute correct results even when the 
	CPU time was below one milli-second.

-	Bourne Shell: dir*/ is no longer left unexpanded but now expands to dir/
	This is one of the most important changes to make the Bourne Shell usable
	for dayly use.

-	bsh & Bourne Shell: the file .globals and .locals are now ignored
	in case they are symlinks

-	Bourne Shell: a leftover debug printf() in args.s was removed.

-	Bourne Shell: chk_access() is now written cleaner, supports F_OK and uses
	faccessat(name, amode, AT_EACCESS) if available.

-	Bourne Shell: Fhe following POSIX test(1) conditions have been added:

	-e	Check the existense of a file
	-S	Check whether a file is a socket

-	Bourne Shell: Fhe following extended test(1) conditions have been added:

	-D	Check whether a file is a door
	-C	Check whether a file is contiguous
	-P	Check whether a file is an event port
	-G	Check whether a file is owned by our currrent effective user id
	-O	Check whether a file is owned by our currrent effective group id
	-N	Check whether file is written more recent than read
	-o opt	Check whether option "opt" is "on".
	-o ?opt Check whether an option named "opt" is valid.
	file1 -ef file2 whether file1 and file2 refer to the same file
	file1 -nt file2 whether file1 exists and file2 not or file1 newer than file2
	file1 -ot file2 whether file2 exists and file1 not or file1 older than file2

-	Bourne Shell: option parsing was rewritten to allow to implement
	-o opt and -o ?opt

-	bsh: Fhe following extended test(1) conditions have been added:

	-D	Check whether a file is a door
	-P	Check whether a file is an event port

-	Bourne Shell: >> now opens the file with O_APPEND

-	Bourne Shell: set -C, set -o noclobber and >| name are now supported.

-	Bourne Shell: exec -a name args..... now allows to set argv[0] via the
	-a argument.

-	The following bug was been detected in the Bourne Shell:

		(exec ps)

	may cause the Bourne Shell to stop with SIGTTIN. The reason has to be
	investigated.

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
