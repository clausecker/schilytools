New features with AN-2019-06-13:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. If your smake is too old and aborts, ensure this
	*** by calling:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4
	The recent smake version is smake-1.3

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-01-26 introduced
	*** optimizations for the Schily version of SunPro Make, you
	*** need at least the dmake version from 2018/01/11 with support
	*** for the "export" directive to compile with this makefile system.


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	BUG WARNING: Please never report bugs to Linux distributions as they
		usually do not forward these bug reports upstream and as the
		Linux distributions typically do not let skilled people check
		the bugs. We did not hear about a FIFO problem in star for a
		long time and since the problem that (on Linux) occurred once
		every 6000-10000 tries did not happen on Solaris after
		10 million tries, it was not known otherwise.

-	cal: The code now correctly deals with a switch date that affects
	December and January. This allows to verify switch dates that become
	effective with January 1st and need to have all skipped days in
	December.

-	cdrecord: The man page now lists all supported media types and which
	media types are preferred over others. This is aimed to tell people
	to use DVD+R/DL instead of DVD-R/DL, while using DVD-R and DVD-RW
	in favor of DVD+R...

-	patch: #ifdef HAVE_RENAME has been removed. We now use the rename()
	emulation from libschily in case rename() does not exists on a specific
	platform.

-	star: fixed a bug in the FIFO code that mainly happened on Linux (with
	a 1000x higher probability than it happens on Solaris). The bug was 
	caused, as a check for a flag has been done twice instead of only once
	where it could change it's value between both locations. As a 
	result, star reported "star: Implementation botch: with FIFO_MEOF"
	as the tar side of the FIFO did sometimes not wait for the FIFO_IWAIT
	state when called as "star -multivolume -tv f=... f=... ...
	For this reason, star incorrectly got a wakeup at the wrong location.

	The bug appeared in case that star -x/-t -multivol f=.. f=.. ....
	has been called with very small tar archives.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting.

-	star: The FIFO code renamed the "flag" member of the "m_head" structure
	to "gflag" for better readability.

-	star: The debugging code in the FIFO has been enhanced to print the
	names of the flag bits in addition to the hex values.

-	star: A deadlock situation that happens once every 500000 tries on
	Linux with multi-volume archives has been fixed.

	The problem was caused by a complex condition where the get side
	of the FIFO needs to check the EOF FIFO flag and the amount of data
	available in the FIFO and then decide whether to wait for a wakeup or
	not.

	Since the EOF flag needs to be checked first, a context switch in
	the get side of the FIFO could allow the put side to set the EOF flag
	before the get side did check the fill ratio of the FIFO. This
	caused both the get side and the put side to wait for a wakeup.

	The new code introduced a new variable mp->mayoblock that is set by
	the get side before checking for EOF. This new flags allows the
	put side to know that the get side is just in a critical situation
	and lets the put side wait until mp->mayoblock is no longer set,
	which signals a stable state in the get side. This permits to
	avoid the deadlock.

-	star: Note that the FIFO has been initially written as a lock free
	design in the late 1980's. This is to allow high portability to even
	older UNIX versions. The star FIFO works on all UNIX variants that
	support pipes and shared memory, which is e.g. the case for
	SunOS-4.0 from 1988. At the time the FIFO has been designed, the
	target OS did not support multi-CPU systems and problems in the
	FIFO first appeared with massively faster multi-CPU systems around
	y2000. The recently detected problems all have been triggered by a
	different context switch behavior on Linux, even though they could
	have appeared on any OS in case that many million tries are
	attempted.

-	star: bumped version to 1.6.1

-	Bourne Shell: A new option "set -o globskipdot" has been added.
	If set, the entries "."  and ".." are skipped and not shown in globbing
	results. If not set, the entries "."  and ".." are always returned,
	even when they are not part of the readdir(3) results.

-	Bourne Shell: The option "set -o globskipdot" has been made the
	new dfault behavior for "bosh", but not for "pbosh"

	Note that this new shell option has been introduced as a result
	of a related BUG discussion in the Austin Group telephone conference.
	The background is to permit shell scripts to check whether a shell
	grants to hide the "."  and ".." for all filesystems.

-	bsh: When expanding file names, the directory entries . and ..
	are now skipped and not part of the results. This is to make bsh
	to behave similar to the Bourne Shell with respect to globbing.


-	SCCS TODO:

	-	Convert sccs.c to use -NSCCS in the back end programs instead
		of converting g-file names from the command line into s.file
		names in the frontend in order to forward s.file names to the
		backend programs. Doing it this way allows us to have the SCCS
		history files "off tree" in a separate directory tree starting
		with ".sccs/" at the "project root" directory, as the related
		code to convert path names is in libcomobj::bulkprepare().

	-	Add code to admin(1) and delta(1) to retrieve the list of
		new or modified files in order to have all important code
		for a "sccs commit" in a single program that does not need to
		deal with ARG_MAX limitations.

	-	Add code to admin(1), delta(1) and get(1) to maintain/understand
		the changeset file.

	-	Add code to libcomobj to understand the changeset file,
		which is needed in order to e.g. know the file names and file
		specific SIDs/state that correspond to a project global SID.

	-	Add code to all programs to maintain a lock (for the file
		$PROJECTHOME/.sccs/SCCS/s.changeset, that would be in the file
		$PROJECTHOME/.sccs/SCCS/z.changeset) to maintain a project
		global lock.

	-	Find/verify a complete transactional model that allows to repair
		complex changes to the set of files for a project that have
		been aborted in the middle. The current idea is to create the
		file $PROJECTHOME/.sccs/changeset with the deltas to the
		changeset during a complex update operation.

	-	Find a way to decide when to use SCCS v6 type history files.
		For the project mode, this is needed in order to prevent 
		historic SCCS implementations to believe they could modify
		files without knowing about project global locks.





-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.

-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
