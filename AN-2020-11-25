New features with AN-2020-11-25:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a newer smake
	*** to compile this source. If your smake is too old and aborts, ensure to
	*** use the recent smake by calling:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4
	The recent smake version is smake-1.3

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2018-01-26 introduced
	*** optimizations for the Schily version of SunPro Make, you
	*** need at least the dmake version from 2018/01/11 with support
	*** for the "export" directive to compile with this makefile system.


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	BUG WARNING: Please never report bugs only to Linux distributions as
		they usually do not forward these bug reports upstream and as
		the Linux distributions typically do not let skilled people
		check the bugs. We did not hear about a FIFO problem in star
		for a long time. Then a problem on Linux occurred once
		every 6000-10000 tries but it did not happen on Solaris after
		even 10 million tries, so it was not known besides Linux.

	BUG WARNING: *** GNU make *** starts too early with parallel
		execution (when reading Makefiles and evaluating rules for
		"include" statements already). Since GNU make does not
		support a concept for a correct ordering of such actions,
		you need to be prepared to see gmake fail in parallel
		mode. If you are interested in reliable parallel execution,
		it is recommended to use the included "dmake" program with
		a command line like:

			dmake -j10 -f SMakefile

		from the top level directory. Note that if you are on Linux,
		you need a halfway recent kernel or the compile time will not
		go down because of the low POSIX semaphore performance in
		older Linux kernels.

		The "dmake" program included in the schilytools tarball is the
		current version of the "new" SunOS make program that has been
		introduced in January 1986 by Sun Microsystems. It also
		introduced new features like the "include" directive that
		3 years later have been copied by gmake in a partially buggy
		way. As gmake does not fix showstopper bugs, it cannot be
		supported. Current showstoppers are: 1) gmake executes
		"include" related rules in the inverse order, causing rules
		to fail if they depend on files created by an "earlier" action
		2) gmake caches an outdated state of the directory and aborts
		with a wrong complain about allegedly missing files that in
		fact exist already.


-	Makefile System: Added support for MacOS on arm64

	Thanks to a hint from Ryan Schmidt from macports

	Note that due to outstanding replies to recent changes in configure,
	it could up to now not be verified that all configure tests now work in
	a way that results in correct overall results. See below for an in 
	depth report on the changes.

-	Makefile System: autoconf (config.guess & config.sub) now supports
	the new arm64 Apple systems.

	Thanks to Ryan Schmidt from macports for provinding the needed uname(1)
	output.

-	Makefile System: Added a new shell script "autoconf/uname" that helps
	to create shell scrips that allow to emulate an alien host system in
	order to test the correct behavior of configure.guess and configure.sub
	on the main development platform.

	This helps to adapt configure.guess and configure.sub to new platforms
	in the future.

-	Makefile System: The new clang compiler as published with the upcomming
	ARM macs has been preconfigured with

		-Werror -Wimplicit-function-declaration

	as the default behavior and thus is in conflict with the existing base
	assumption of the autoconf system that minimalistic C-code used for
	compile/link allows to check for the existence of a specific function
	in libc without a need to know which system #include file is used to
	define a prototype for that function.

	This clang version, as a result of this default, behaves like a C++
	compiler and aborts if a function is used with no previous function
	prototype. This caused most of the existing autoconf test to fail with
	error messages about missing prototypes.

	We implemented a workaround using these methods for the identified
	problems:

	-	Most of the exit() calls in the various main() functions have 
		been replaced by return() to avoid a need to 
		#include <stdlib.h> in special since these test may be the
		case for layered tests that #include files from the higher
		level parts.

	-	Many autoconf tests programs now #include more system include
		files, e.g. stdlib.h and unistd.h to avoid missing prototype
		errors. This cannot reliably be done in tests that are used as
		a base for higher level tests where the high level test 
		#includes own system include files, since older platforms do 
		not support to #include the same file twice.

		So this is tricky...

	-	A test for a Linux glibc bug caused by incorect #pragma weak
		usage inside glibc that prevents one or more functions from
		ecvt()/fcvt()/gcvt() from being usable outside glibc now uses
		hand-written prototypes for some of the libc interface
		functions in order to avoid using the system includes. If we
		did not do that, we could not use ecvt()/fcvt()/gcvt() on
		MacOS anymore.

	Thanks to Ryan Schmidt from macports for reporting and for the given
	help that was needed for remote debugging.

	Please send the needed feedback on whether the current state of the
	configure script results on correct autoconf results on the M1 Macs.

-	makefiles: A new copy of makefiles.tar.bz2 replaces the old one from
	may 2020.

-	libhfs_iso: changed malloc() to calloc() to avoid uninitialized data.
	Missing initialization caused junk in the filesystem and fdisk
	partition created by mkisofs with the -chrp-boot or -part option.

	Thanks to Jan Engelhardt for reporting

-	libxtermcap: The new version does no longer free the allocated buffer
	and copies the failing filename into this buffer in case that an
	open() call fails. This allows to find the filename of the failing
	termcap database in case that the last entry from the TERMPATH
	could not be opened.

-	ved/ctags: The makefile to install vctags.1 was called Makefile.man 
	but needs to be named Mctags.man because this is the name used in
	the main Makefile.

	Thanks to Jan Engelhardt for reporting

-	ved/vctags: the vctags binary and man page have been added to the
	SVr4 packet meta data for the OpenCSW package "CSWved".

-	ved/p/termcap/Bourne Shell: The documentation for the TERMPATH
	environment variable has been wrong and was fixed regarding the fact
	that $HOME is only prepended to the path if TERMPATH is empty and
	the implcit (compiled in) search path is used.

-	ved/bsh/Bourne Shell: A new set of dotfiles.tar.bz2 is available.
	The $HOME/.termcap file now includes a minimalistic "ansi" entry
	taken from the Solaris /etc/termcap file. It is identical to the
	compiled-in ansi termcap entry from the new ved, see below.

-	ved: A new colon command (ESC : vhelp) has been added. The reason
	for this command is to make it easy to edit the online help file
	even in case the keyboard in use is a PC based keyboard where the
	Delete key creates backspace as its output. On such a keyboard, it
	would otherwise be hard to enter ^X^H, since ^H would be mapped
	to DEL before it is seen by inpout reader of ved.

-	ved: The documentation in "vedsheet.tr" and "ved.help" now mentions
	the new colon command that is called via ESC : vhelp

-	ved: The error message for the case that a matching TERM entry could
	not be found now contains the errno related string if applicable.

-	ved: The editor binary now contains a compiled-in termcap entry
	for a minimalistic ansi compatible terminal to avoid problems
	in case that there is no installed termcap data base on the 
	current system.

	Thanks to a hint from Sven Guckes

-	ved: If the tgetent() call to retrieve a termcap entry for the
	current terminal fails, ved now implicitely used the compiled-in
	minimalistic ansi terminal description. In order to help users,
	ved also writes some help to stderr, explaining that the problem
	could be avoided if a suitable termcap data-base was installed.

	In such a case, ved then waits for a second and continues.

-	ved: The man page now explains that ved is using te real termcap
	database instead of a database emulated via terminfo.

-	ved: The man page now explains that it is possible to create a 
	private termcap entry for an unknown (to termcap) terminal by
	calling:

		infocmp -C >> $HOME/.termcap

	Thanks to a hint from Sven Guckes

-	ved: If ved is called without file type argument and there is
	no .vedtmp file, ved now edits a scratchfilename in a way that
	forbids to write the "original filename" back using the QUIT
	command. Previous versions of ved did write an error message,
	explaining that a file type argument is missing.

	Thanks to a hint from Sven Guckes
	Thanks to a discussion with Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	SunPro Make: The new speudo target .NOTPARALLEL is now ignored, when
	make is in (Sun 2006) SunPro compat mode or when it emulates SYSv make.

-	SunPro Make: The man page replaced some headlines that incorrectly 
	have been printed out in italics. The new corrected headlines are
	printed in bold.

-	SunPro Make: The man page incorrectly listed suffix rules since it
	did not include a needed newline before the rule command.

-	SunPro Make: The make macro assignment operators ?= and ::= that 
	will be introduced with the next POSIX standard have been
	implemented. Note that the current proposed text in POSIX for +=
	(which is supported by SunPro Make since January 1986 - 3 years
	before gmake was written) is inacceptable as it tries to standardize
	a design bug from gmake. There is related a pending bugreport to fix
	the POSIX text.

-	SunPro Make: Execept when on HP-UX or Linux, a structure definition
	for the enum used to remember the build state value was a bitmap 
	that did only hold 3 bits. The enum was defined to hold
	8 different values, so there was no reserve for future expansions.
	We now use 8 bits instead of 3 bits.

-	SunPro Make: The man page now mentions that if no target argument
	is used on the command line, make selectes the first **regular**
	target seen in the makefile to become the default target.

-	SunPro Make: The man page fixed a textual incorrectness in the 
	description for the "macro:shell= command" assignment description.
	The previous claim was that make macros in the output are expanded, 
	but make rather expands make macros in the command line **before**
	calling the command.

-	SunPro Make: The man page now documents the presiously undocumented
	$(VAR:shell) macro reference which does the same as the $(VAR:sh)
	macro reference.

-	SunPro Make: The man page corrected the syntax description for the
	"Makefile Target Entries" section. : or :: are now correctly mentioned
	as mandatory and more than one possible target entry is listed before
	the : / :: to make the explaining text easier to understand.

-	SunPro Make: The #ifdefs for the -x option have been corrected to
	enable the -x option in our parallel mode that is a subset of the
	previous "TEAMWARE" distributed mode used by Sun that we cannot 
	support because too few source code has been given away by Sun.

-	SunPro Make: The enhancement to the option parser from 2017 that 
	since then permits -j# in addition to -j # introduced a bug that did
	prevent the -x option from working correctly. The related problem
	has been fixed.

-	SunPro Make: The man page now documents the -x option that was
	undocumented by the man page as published by Sun.




-	SCCS: The current idea for converting a historic SCCS project into
	a project oriented SCCS history bundle is the following:

	-	Create a user map file for "sccslog" by calling:

		mkdir $HOME/.sccs
		$EDITOR $HOME/.sccs/usermap

		Enter the UNIX login names followed by a TAB, followed
		by an E-mail notation. Use one line per user, e.g.

			joerg	J. Schilling <joerg@mail.com>

	-	Create a copy of the whole project to work on for this test.
		Do not do this conversion on the original project until
		sccs-6.0 is ready.

	-	chdir to the project home directory of the just created copy.

	-	Call "sccs init -i ." to make the project using an in-tree
		project oriented repository.

	-	Call:

		find * -path '*SCCS/s.*' | /opt/schily/ccs/bin/sccscvt -NSCCS/s. -k -ooo -V6 -

		for the CSRG BSD project use:

		find * -path '*SCCS/s.*' | TZ=US/Pacific /opt/schily/ccs/bin/sccscvt -NSCCS/s. -k -ooo -V6 -

		to convert all history files into SCCSv6 history files. The
		TZ=US/Pacific is important for the UCB conversion since SCCSv6
		uses timezones but SCCSv4 does not and we need to have the 
		correct timezone entries in the SCCSv6 history files.

		For the complete "schilytools" project with 4200 SCCS history
		files in 55 Mbytes, this takes 12 seconds for the SCCS history
		from 1984 .. 2020, but note that most of the edits from the
		1980s are lost, so there are few entries from the time
		before 1989.

		An alternate example: the SCCS history from the BSD-4.4 project
		from December 1979 up to June 1995 is in 12600 SCCS history
		files that take up 125 MB.
		The conversion time to the SCCSv6 history file format is
		18 seconds.

	-	Call:

		find * -path '*SCCS/s.*' | /opt/schily/ccs/bin/sccslog -changeset -

		to populate the changeset file from the existing deltas.

		For the complete "schilytools" project with 19600 commits,
		this takes 8 minutes. The resulting file .sccs/SCCS/s.changeset
		has a size of approx. 7 MBytes.

		An alternate example: the SCCS history from the BSD-4.4 project
		from December 1979 up to June 1995 has approx. 47000 commits.
		The conversion time is approx. 40 minutes.
		The size of the resulting changeset file is approx. 14 MBytes.

	-	convert the in-tree repository into an off-tree repository.
		This final step is not yet needed and there is currently no
		code to do that automatically.

	-	If you like to check the resulting changeset file, there is
		currently only one way to look at it, by calling:

		sccs -O get -p -A -m .sccs/SCCS/s.changeset | more

		This prints an annotated version of the changeset file.
		The next task is to develop an enhancement to "sccs log"
		that prints the changeset in a way similar to what "hg log -v"
		prints.

	-	NOTE: Normal filesystems on Linux are slow, it is advised to
		make the conversions on tmpfs for performance reasons in case
		you are using Linux.

	Please however keep in mind that this is still experimental and there is
	absolutely no grant that a changelog created with current experimental
	software will work correctly with the final SCCS version. The procedure
	is just an example to check how it may look like.

	The final conversion method will be more automated... most likely
	by a command similar to "sccs import ..."

	IMPORTANT: This is not yet the time to finally convert a project into
	the project mode, because the project would be stuck in the current 
	state. What we need to continue work in that repository state in the
	project mode is at least a working "sccs commit". Be prepared to remove
	the changeset history file once "sccs commit" works and to re-create
	the changeset file for that time.

 

-	SCCS TODO:

	-	Activate "fsdiff" as a "bdiff" replacement in delta(1)
		to speed up delta(1) and to reduce the size of the SCCS
		history files.

	-	Implement something that outputs similar information from
		the changeset file as printed with "hg log -v".

		This would be the next key feature.

	-	verify whether sccs.c uses -NSCCS in the back end programs
		correctly, instead of converting g-file names from the command
		line into s.file names in the frontend in order to forward 
		s.file names to the backend programs. This is needed for an
		off-tree repository.

		The related unit tests are already passed.

	-	Add code to to sccs(1) to send a list of files to admin(1) and
		delta(1) with new or modified files in order to have all
		important code for a "sccs commit" in a single program that
		does not need to deal with ARG_MAX limitations.

	-	Add code to admin(1), delta(1), sccs-log(1) and get(1) to 
		maintain/understand the changeset file.

		This is mainly writing out the sccschangeset(4) entries to an
		intermediate store if a single file has been treated
		successfully. For sccs-log(1), see below.

	-	Finish the work to allow normal line based diffs in SCCS even
		for binary files. This are files that include nul bytes and
		this needs to completely avoid fputs() and this needs an 
		initialized member p_line_length in struct packet even for 
		all content that does not result from a previous getline() call.

	-	sccs -R tell (and probably other subcommands?) does not yet
		work in NewMode

	-	Add code to libcomobj to understand the changeset file.
		This is needed in order to e.g. know the file names and file
		specific SIDs/state that corresponds to a project global SID.

	-	Find/verify a complete transactional model that allows to repair
		complex changes to the set of files for a project that have
		been aborted in the middle. The current idea is to create the
		file $PROJECTHOME/.sccs/changeset with the deltas to the
		changeset during a complex update operation.

	-	Find a decision on how to deal with the admin flags that are
		currently implemented as global flags and thus do not depend on
		the SID (version) if the history file.

	-	Aborting a transaction via ^C currently requires a manual
		removal of the global lock file. Find a way to avoid this in
		case that a commit has been aborted while being prompted for
		a commit message (which is before any real action happened).

	-	Implement a fully automated method to convert a SCCSv4 based
		history with unrelated history files into a new SCCSv6 based
		project mode history with a populated changeset history file.

		This will most likely be done as a variant of the to be defined
		new command "sccs sccsimport" that imports a whole existing old
		SCCS project.

	-	Implement this "sccs sccsimport" based conversion in a way where
		sccs(1) holds the global changeset lock for the whole time
		of the conversion.




-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.

-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
