New features with AN-2013-11-25:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	configure now also checks for NFSv4 ACL related library extensions
	from FreeBSD

-	include/schily/stdio.h now finally works to compile libshedit on
	Linux _and_ to pass the program "hdrchk" from OpenSolaris.

-	libschily/strstr.c and libschily/wcsstr.c now include a 
	CDDL License hint

-	A typo in the use of the new macro: $(OSINCDIRS)
	was fixed in order to make things compile again on FreeBSD.
	Now using $(OSINCDIRS:%=-I%) instead of $(OSINCDIRS)

-	Star now gives a warning when comppiled on an old version of
	Solaris (that does not support NFSv4 ACLs) when NFSv4 ACLs
	are seen in extract mode.

-	Star now correctly frees the NFSv4 ACL structure delivered from
	calling acl_fromtext(path, &aclp), using acl_free() instead
	of just calling free().

-	Star now compiles on Solaris 10 that missed important include
	files for NFSv4 ACLs. Thanks to Dennis Clarke for reporting.

-	Cddda2wav now flushes stderr before asking for a specific cddb
	entry index. It seems that on Linux stderr may not be unbuffered
	as expected.

-	Cdda2wav moved the option parsing code into a separate function
	gargs().

-	Cdrecord/Cdda2wav/Readcd: trying to avoid to confuse users
	on Solaris and Linux where a fine grained privilege implementation
	exists. Before, fine grained privileges have been given up after
	initializing the program and this may result in a root user that
	is treated as a normal user that cannot write into directories 
	without global write permission. The named programs now no longer
	give up privileges in case they have been called with the needed
	privileges already and thus the programs cannot be used for
	privilege escalations anymore.

-	Libfind now allows to check for -type P (Solaris event port).
	A missing "case 'P':" was added to the parser.

-	Cdrtools bumped to 3.01a19
