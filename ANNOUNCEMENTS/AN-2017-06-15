New features with AN-2017-06-15:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	configure: the test for libnsl now uses gethostbyname() instead of 
	inet_ntoa() and also checks for "libnetwork". This should finally cover
	Haiku to fully automatically compile SunPro Make.

-	SunPro Make: With the new autoconf test from above, SunPro Make now
	should compile and run on Haiku.

-	smake: Added new automake code that supports the rules for "uname -p"
	from Haiku.

-	cdrecord: man page now mentions the exit code

-	readcd: man page now mentions the exit code

-	SCCS: "bdiff" no longer tries to install a signel handler for
	SIGCHLD and then exits after the called "diff" program exited.
	This was caused by an unusual numbering for the signals on Haiku.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	SCCS: "delta" now prints the really used path for the diff program
	in some failure cases.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	patch: The conformance tests "cmptest" and "gentest" now also check
	for "/bin/patch" while searching for a reference patch binary.
	This is needed s Haiku does not have a /usr/bin/ directory.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	patch: The conformance tests "cmptest" and "gentest" now also check
	whether the system supports an "ed" binary and skips "diff -e" tests
	in case "ed" is missing. This is needed on Haiku that does not have
	an "ed" binary.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	star: The conformance tests that check the star -tv behavior now set
	the timezone to GMT to get a test result that does not depend on the
	configured timezone of the system.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	Bourne Shell: set -u now aborts arithmetic expressions with unset
	variables.

	Thanks to a report from Robert Elz

-	Bourne Shell: If the shell starts up in interactive mode, it
	now auto-enables the monitor mode (set -m) as this is required
	by POSIX.

-	Bourne Shell: The command

		( trap "echo exiting" EXIT; /usr/bin/true )

	no longer optimizes out the fork() for /usr/bin/true and thus
	is able to fire the trap command.

	This is a bug that is present in the Bourne Shell since 1977.

	Thanks to a report from Robert Elz

-	Bourne Shell: The parser for ${var#value} has been restructured
	to check for ${var##value} before value is expanded. This
	permits to expand X=# ${var#$X} correctly.

	Thanks to a report from Robert Elz

-	Bourne Shell: added a compliance test for the above case.

-	Bourne Shell: the command

		sh -c 'set -- a b c d; echo ${4294967297}'

	no longer prints "a", as there now is an overflow check.

	Thanks to a report from Robert Elz

-	Bourne Shell: added a compliance test for the above case.

-	Bourne Shell: Avoid an endless loop while getting a hard
	EOF inside "${..}"

	Thanks to a report from Robert Elz

-	Bourne Shell: the command:

		bosh -c '(set -e; ! false; echo OK); echo OK'

	now prints two times "OK" as expected. This happens as the
	evaluation for "set -e" for builtin commands now has been fully moved 
	into the the main interpreter code. The same modification now causes:

		bosh -c '(set -e; time false)'

	to print the timing results before exiting the shell.

	Thanks to a report from Robert Elz

-	Bourne Shell: A bug in arithmetic expansion with nested backtick-
	style command substitutions like:

		bosh -c 'echo $(( `echo 77` `echo -` `echo 44` ))'

	has been fixed.

	Thanks to a report from Robert Elz

-	Bourne Shell: added a compliance test for the above case.

-	Bourne Shell: echo ${#:-99} does now do what is expected.

	Thanks to a report from Robert Elz

-	Bourne Shell: added a compliance test for the above case.

-	Bourne Shell: echo ${#-99} ${#+99} ${#?99} and ${#=99}
	now work as well, while the corner case ${#?} behaves as it
	did before.

	Thanks to a report from Robert Elz

-	Bourne Shell: added a compliance test for the above case.

-	Bourne Shell: IFS=5; echo $(( 123456789 )) now works as
	expected.

	Thanks to a report from Robert Elz

-	Bourne Shell: added a compliance test for the above case.

-	Bourne Shell: The man page now mentions the flags -b and -C
	in the SYNOPSIS description.

-	Bourne Shell: The man page no longer mentions

		IFS=X
		echoXfoo

	as this problem does no longer exist in POSIX mode.

-	Bourne Shell: added two new tests from Robert Elz to check the
	correct handling of backslash-newline sequences.

-	Old Bourne Shell: A man page was added.
	This was needed as some distributions seem to be interested
	to include a portable shell that is 100% compliant with the
	Historic Bourne Shell as distributed with OpenSolaris.




-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.



-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
