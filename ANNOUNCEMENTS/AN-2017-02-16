New features with AN-2017-02-16:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	libschily: added a missing null-byte to the filename in the
	opendir() emulation for Win-DOS.

	Thanks to Collin Finck colin@reactos.org for reporting

-	libschily: The movebytes() man page now mentions other *bytes()
	functions.

-	libschily: cmpbytes() new man page

-	libstreamar: A new library for StreamArchives,
	simple archives based on POSIX.1-2001 tar extended headers.

	This library is based on code from star and implements a simple but
	highly extensible and very compact archive format that may be used 
	e.g. on network streams	to bundle a set of files.

	Check "man streamarchive" to understand the structure of a
	StreamArchive.

	This library is intended to be used by the upcomming network
	features in SCCS.

-	Bourne Shell: Fixed a bug with the libshedit interface that was 
	introduced in the last release and caused "echo `ls *.c`" to
	fail in an interactive shell.

-	SCCS: diff did not always exit(2) in case of errors since the code
	was restructured in late 2016.

-	SCCS: new help page: "sccs help admin_flags" prints a summary od the
	flags supported by the admin command.

-	SCCS: "sccs get SCCS" no longer suppresses keyword expansion in case
	that the 's' flag is set. Old versions did not reset the line count
	for multiple files, the new version uses the "line number in g-file"
	variable in struct packet instead and thus something that gets reset
	automatically.

-	SCCS: the man page sccs-delta.1 has been enhanced to mention that
	the force delta option (-f) is usually used together with -q and -n.

-	SCCS: the man page sccsfile.4 has been enhanced with respect to
	the weave format.

-	SCCS: added a test to verify that the admin -fs# flag works correctly
	even  when retrieving more than one file at once.

-	ved: sleep one second past writing the warning "BAD POS in .vedtmp"
	because this text may get overwritten by "READ ONLY ..."

-	cstyle: fixed a typo in the man page.
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	cpp: fixed a typo in the man page.
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	bsh: fixed various typos in the man page.
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	star: table.c & table.h: changed some tables from signed char
	to uint8_t as the values are used as index for other tables.

-	strar: A new command to handle StreamArchives has been added.

	Note that this command extracts files always in "install" mode.
	This is implemented by first extracting the file under a random name
	and to atomically rename it to the final original name using
	"rename(2)".

	Missing intermediate directories are created by default.

	This command is usable for basic work already The following features
	are currently missing:

	-	A noclobber flag

	-	A method to avoid to replace files that are more recent on
		disk than in the archive.

	-	Set the file permissions

	-	Set the original file time stamps

	-	Set the original file owners.

	These features will be implemented in a future version.




-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.


-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Try to make

		lastline=
		while read line
		do
			lastline=$line
		done < /etc/passwd
		echo "lastline=$lastline"

		print the last line of /etc/passwd without the exec "trick"
		that is documented in the man page.
	
	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
