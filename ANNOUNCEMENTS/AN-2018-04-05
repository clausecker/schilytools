New features with AN-2018-04-05:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. If your smake is too old and aborts, ensure this
	*** by calling:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-01-26 introduced
	*** optimizations for the Schily version of SunPro Make, you
	*** need at least the dmake version from 2018/01/11 with support
	*** for the "export" directive to compile with this makefile system.


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	Schily Makefilesystem: $(PREINSDIR) was added to the install target
	path for more flexibility.

-	Schily.Copyright: Updated Copyright dates.
	Added information for the programs "cstyle", "isaexec", "libboshcmd",
	"libdbgmalloc", "osh", "tests".

-	conf/cc-config.sh The version from Ferbruary 1 2018 has issues:
	clang has not been correctly discovered on FreeBSD
	gcc on Ubunto has no longer been correctly discovered

-	include/schily/mconfig.h: As part of the schily portability
	framework now includes code to auto-detect GCC and Clang with
	enabled Address Sanitizer.

-	libschily: handlecond()/raisecond() now use the fallback implementation
	when the code is compiled with Address Sanitizer support enabled. This
	is needed as handlecond() marks the saved framepointer on the stack
	in order to install a software signal handler.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting.

-	libschily: getfp() is automatically disabled when the code is compiled
	with Address Sanitizer support enabled.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting.

-	libschily: dlerror() emulation: the POSIX standard defies it as:

		char *dlerror()

	but we had const char *dlerror()

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting.

-	libschily: match.c could access data past the end of a string in case
	that the pattern was illegal (e.g. "[0-]"). We now no longer treat
	'-' special in case that it appears at the end of a set	pattern.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting.

-	ved/bsh/libshedit: map.c did dereference a NULL pointer in case that
	someone tried to delete a mapping when no mapping exists.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting.

-	bsh: A file with the content "if 0" did cause the shell to try to access
	lp[-1] in cond.c

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting.

-	bsh: A file with the content "#!" did cause the shell to try to
	dereference a NULL pointer.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting.

-	bsh: the own malloc() implementation is now automatically disabled when
	compiling with Address Sanitizer support enabled. This is needed as the
	address sanitizer replaces malloc() with an own implementation that is
	in conflict with out malloc() implementation.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting.

-	smake: The inline "echo" implementation did not correctly parse the
	command line.

	Thanks to Steffen Nurpmeso for reporting.

-	star: A new message "Badly formed number '%s'.\n" has been introduced to
	help to identify illegal arguments to complex options like fs=.

-	star: The man page has been enhanced in order to reduce the chance
	to missunderstand descriptions.

-	hdump: The od(1) man page from OpenSolaris has been integrated since our
	hdump implementation has been enhanced in 2010 in order to replace the
	closed source od implementation from OpenSolaris.

-	hdump: The hdump(1) man page now mentions the options -C, -O, -s, -S,
	-x, -X and better deals with the object size.

-	hdump: "od file1 123 file2" no longer believes file2 is the hdump
	"count", but rather tries to display three files: "file1", "123", "file2"
	as required by "od.

-	hdump: When in hdump mode, a simple "starting offset" number no longer
	switches the radix to octal, but leaves the address radix hexadecimal
	and interprets the "starting offset" as decimal.

-	smake: The builtin optimization for "echo" in smake needs to understand
	where a echo command ends in a semicolon, but this detection did
	incorrectly hit inside a "" or '' string and send the parts to the
	right of the semocolon to the shell.

	Thanks to Steffen Nurpmeso for reporting.

-	cdrecord: The version date was added to the cdrecord -version output

-	cdda2wav: The version date was added to the cdda2wav -version output

-	mkisofs: The version date was added to the mkisofs -version output

-	mkisofs: a possible core dump with code conversion for Joliet has
	been fixed. The bug has been introduced with schilytools--2018-01-26

	Thanks to Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de> (SuSE) for reporting.

-	SunPro Make: Some printf() arguments have been removed that have been
	left over by Sun Microsystems from a former code restructuring.

-	SunPro Make: The return code from getcwd() is now evaluated.

-	SunPro Make: The man page now mentions that the current version
	of make forwards command line macros to sub-makes.

-	SunPro Make: Added an unneeded D_NONE case label to make clang quiet.

-	SCCS: The SCCS help file installation now makes use of the new
	makefile feature $(PREINSDIR).

-	SCCS: The SCCS binaries installation now makes use of the new
	makefile feature $(PREINSDIR).

-	SCCS: The help program now also auto expands help messages for own
	malfunctions.

-	SCCS: The sccs-help.1 man page now explains the algorithm, the
	way localization works and how the file /usr/ccs/lib/help/helploc
	works.

-	SCCS: The sccs-get.1 man page now includes the fallback PATH for the
	&sccs.include.filename% keyword directive.

-	SCCS: all commands: SCCS_HELP_PRE and SCCS_BIN_PRE are now used for
	external files and for searching the locale definition files.

-	SCCS: README.SCCS now mentions the new make command line macro options
	SCCS_HELP_PRE and SCCS_BIN_PRE. See $(PREINSDIR) above.

-	SCCS: unit tests now honor SCCS_BIN_PRE.



-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.

-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
