New features with AN-2017-10-10:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4


-	libschily::match.c: patmbmatch() fixes a typo in the parameters
	of mbtowc() that was introduced in July 2017 and is now usable - and
	used by the new version of "p".

-	p: Searching works again. The conversion to support multi-byte chars
	caused the buffer filling to be cometimes skipped.

-	p: Searching (from more prompt) now supports multi byte chars.

-	p: the "underlining removal" function is now only called if underlining
	is in effect and a backspace is seen in the current buffer.

-	p: the search code now supports finding text in bold or underlined words
	in case that the characters in the words contain multi-byte characters.

-	Bourne Shell: the test suite introduced new variables that are set to
	"true" in case a specific shell implementation was identified.

	Available are now: "is_osh" if the portable Solaris compatible
	Bourne Shell was detected and "is_bourne" it true in case any Bourne
	Shell compatible shell was detected.

-	Bourne Shell: aliases are no longer tested by the test suite in case
	that a Bourne Shell (not supporting aliases) was detected.

-	Bourne Shell: the "bugs" tests are now able to switch to the "set -x"
	output method from the historic Bourne Shell.

-	K&R cpp: The output for the __FILE__ macro is now inserting the needed
	backshlash quoting for backslashes in file names. This makes __FILE__
	usable as a C-string.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	K&R cpp: The error message "#if-less #endif" may have caused a core
	dump that happened because we are no longer on UNIX-V7 where a NULL
	pointer may be dereferenced and points to a 0.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	K&R cpp: The "#line # filename" directive no longer ignores it's
	arguments but rather sets the line number and the filename.
	Note that the original Reiser cpp ignored the arguments to "#line".

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	star: Added a new extended header: SCHILY.devminorbits
	This is needed because Solaris uses a different makedev() for 64 bit
	commands and 32 bit commands.

	The new SCHILY.devminorbits allows to convert struct stat.st_dev
	as used by SCHILY.dev into a number that is compatible to the system
	used by the local program. Note that SCHILY.dev is currently not
	used in extract mode, but a value in the archive that does not fit
	into the local dev_t type was flagged by star. This caused a warning
	like this:
	
	star: WARNING: SCHILY.dev '124554051655' in extended header at 3 exceeds local range.

	when the archive created by a 64 bit star on Solaris was fed into
	a 32 bit star.

	Ad a result, tar archives from 64 bit star binaries and 32 bit star
	binaries are now compatible.



-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.

-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
