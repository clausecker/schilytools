New features with AN-2008-09-04:

-	cdrecord now correctly writes DVD+R/DL media with all drives.
	Before, there have been problems at the layer break with some
	drives.

-	sccs get ... now only expands the new four digit-year keywords
	%d% %e% %g% %h% if the 'x' flag has been set with sccs admin or
	if the related keyword has been exlicitely enabled via the 'y'
	flag.

	This has been done because the probabiltiy thar lower case characters
	from printf() format stirngs incorrectly match sccs keywords is too high.
