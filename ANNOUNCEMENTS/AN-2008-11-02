New features with AN-2008-11-02:


-	Extended the file COPYING to mention that the GPL used by the "mkisofs project"
	requires to publish the full source for all parts of mkisofs in case that you
	publish mkisofs binaries.

-	RUlES/rules.prg no longer includes a line with SHELL=/bin/sh.
	This is needed to allow to implement a workaround for various bash
	bugs that afffect makefiles in case that /bin/sh is linked to bash.

	If your platform installs bash in /bin/sh (Linux, ....) or in case
	thaat your platform offers a broken variant of the Korn Shell in /bin/sh
	(like HP-UX), fetch the "Schily source consolidation" from 
	ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/schily/, compile everything and install the
	original Bourne Shell, that comes with this packet, into /bin/bosh.
	If you then call ./.clean and re-compilee everything, you get a "smake"
	that calls /bin/bosh instead of the broken system shell.

-	Added an autoconf test for POSIX violations found in POSIX.1-2008.

	The official POSIX rule is not to define "new" interfaces that
	are in conflict with older interfaces of the same name.
	Our interfaces fexec*() have been defined and published in 1982.
	The new POSIX interfaces define a different interface and the
	new POSIX interfaces even use names that are not compatible with
	POSIX rules. The new POSIX interfaces in question should be called
	fdexec*() to follow the rules of other similar POSIX functions.
	Simiar problems exist with getline()/fgetline().

	We try to automatically rename our functions in case that the functions
	could be found in the local libc.


-	Included a patch for the CAM interface from the FreeBSD people.
	The patch sets up the CAM data structrures in a way that allows
	SCSI bus and target scanning.

-	Try to rename ecvt()/fcgt()/gcvt() in case that one of these functions
	does not work and the libc implementation does not allow to overwrite the
	function.

-	cdrtools bumped to 2.01.01a53

-	Make dure that the DVD and BluRay drivers do not lower the default timeout.
	cdrecord timeout=# now always allows to raise the default timeout to a larger
	value.

-	Added a workaround to prevent the Lite-ON BD B LH-2B1S/AL09
	from hanging up when trying to write a BluRay Medium.

-	Cdrecord now by default tries to set up a DMA Size of 126 kB.
	If non-MMC drives are found, we fall back to the old value of 63 kB

-	The MD5 implemenation for cdda2wav (although currently unused) has been
	changed from the RSA variant (that requires advertizing for RSA)
	to a "public domain" implementation from Colin Plumb used
	in OpenBSD.

-	The new MD5 implementation for cdda2wav has been made portable.

-	A typo in smake was corrected that was a result of copy/paste.
	The typo did prevent compilation on ATARI MINT.

-	The stringstack used in smake to expand teext tokens now always
	reserves one extra byte for the null character at the end.

-	config.sub now supports NetBSD on AMD64

-	Smake now also checks for /opt/schily/bin/bosh as a possible replacement
	for broken shells like "bash" and the Korn Shell found on HP-UX.

-	The email addresses in many file have been updated.

-	The license has been changed from a license (similar to a BSDl 4 clause)
	to a new BSDL 2 clause license with permission from all involved authors.

-	Libcdrdeflt is a new library that has been introduced as mans programs like
	to parse the content of /etc/default/cdrecord

-	Cdrecord man page now includes many small modifications that mention 
	BluRay media.

-	Libcdrdeflt is a new library that has been introduced as mans programs
	like to parse the content of /etc/default/cdrecord

-	Libscgcmd is a new SCSI command library made from very (20 year) old code.

-	cdrecord, readcd, cdda2wav, mkisofs, btcflash, scgcheck, scgskeleton
	Converted to use libcdrdeflt

-	cdrecord, readcd, cdda2wav, mkisofs, btcflash, scgcheck, scgskeleton
	Converted to use libscgcmd

-	The -M/-md5 option in cdda2wav now finally works.
	Cdda2wav now computes MD5-sums for the audio data and writes the result
	into the *.inf files.
