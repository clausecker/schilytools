New features with AN-2015-04-16:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thouroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	Support for x86_64-haiku-cc.rul and x86_64-haiku-gcc.rul was added
	to the makefile system.

-	The file RULES/r-gmake.dep was modified to make fure that the 
	dependency files (*.d) depend from the include files as well.
	Previous versions included xxx.d instread of $(ARCHDIR)/xxx.d

-	smake: the auto .OBJDIR code has been fixed:

	-	smake now takes a note on whether the object file was moved
		to $(.OBJDIR) at all and keep the current path index in
		it's data structures.

	-	smake no longer tries to move a target that includes a
		slash ('/') in it's pathame. This is to align the calling
		code with the behavior of the fnction move_tgt()

	Note that this fix is needed with a planned update of the makefile
	rules for smake in the near future. So be careful and update your
	local smake installation.

-	smake now uses a better hash algorithm. This speeds up smake in case
	that all filenames start with the same char (e.g. $(ARCHDIR)/f.o)

-	smake now implements a more efficient parser to allow to read longer
	object names without extra costs. With this new code, smake now
	only spends 1/10th of the user CPU time used by gmake for the
	same task. Before it was 1/7th of the user CPU time used by gmake.

-	smake now tries to avoid to call streql() at some places that
	need to frequently compare strings. Smake now first compares the
	first character and thus may trop a bundle of streql() calls.

-	bsh/wait3.c now uses pid_t as return type instead if int.

-	The files $HOME/.globals and .locals from bsh and the Bourne Shell
	are now written with mode 0600.

-	The files $HOME/.globals and .locals from bsh and the Bourne Shell
	are no longer read in case that they are writable by others.

-	Bourne Shell: set -n is now ignored when in interactive mode.

-	Bourne Shell: "set -v -x -- 1 2 3" now sets options -v and -x and
	the arg vector to "1 2 3". The unfixed Bourne Shell would set only
	option -v and set the arg vector to "-x -- 1 2 3". The new fix is
	turned on via -DDO_MULTI_OPT

-	Bourne Shell: The shell now supports "set -o vi" and "set -o ved".
	"set -o vi" is required by POSIX and cannot be switched on in the
	Bourne Shell. "set -o ved" is turned on by default if the shell is
	an interacrive shel and tells the shell to implement command line
	editing via the built in ved(1) commands. If turned off, the
	Bourne Shell now behaves eactly like an old Bourne Shell at command
	line prompt level. Previous versions did only allow to disable the
	history via HISTORY=0, but command line editing was still active
	on the current input line.

-	Heiko Eißfeldt started with tests on the Bourne Shell using the
	test software: "american fuzzy lop"

	-	libgetopt/getopt.c no longer causes SIGSEGV with some
		non-conforming shell scripts that call getopts(1).
