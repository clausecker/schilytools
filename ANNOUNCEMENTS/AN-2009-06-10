New features with AN-2009-06-10:

-	The -interactive option for cdda2wav is now mentioned in the -help output 
	and the man page.

-	Call unit_ready() in cdda2wav before retrieving the TOC data in order to work
	around a Solaris scsa2usb (SCSA to USB Driver) bug.

-	isoinfo now prints "???" as month name in case there is an illegal month value
	in the ISO-9660 image instead of omitting the month field. This makes the output
	parsable. Thanks to a hint from Michael Prokop

-	New include file include/schily/limits.h

-	New include file include/schily/locale.h

-	new files in libschily: matchw.c matchwl.c implement wchar_t versions of the
	pattern matcher

-	The history line editor for the shell "bsh" now supports multi byte character
	based locales.

-	The Bourne Shell uses the history line editor from bsh and for this reason now
	also supports multi byte based localed in the line editor.

-	The Bourne Shell now resets the mbtowc() shift state when needed by calling
	mbtowc(NULL, NULL, 0). This is needed in special on Mac OS X.

-	The Bourne Shell now allows to change the history length by changing the value of
	the environment variable HISTORY= during the lifetime of the Bourne Shell.


-	New defaults dir DEFAULTS_CSW holds defaults that limit optimization to Sparc V1.

-	Added support for wide characters:

	-	New autoconf tests for wcs*() functions.

	-	New wcs*() functions in libschily for wide character portability

-	Removed -R../libs/<arch-dir> from the RUN_PATH to keep autpomoutd quiet

-	Added support for 64 Bit compilation on Mac OS X, call make CCOM=cc64 or
	make CCOM=gcc64 as usual for other OS platforms.

-	Trying to deal with the strange type confusions with Mac IOKit and 64 Bit support
