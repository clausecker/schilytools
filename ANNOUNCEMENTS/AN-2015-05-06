New features with AN-2015-05-06:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thouroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4


-	libschily/spawn.c:wait_chld() no longer returns 0 if the child process
	was killed by a signal.

-	libschily now adds some of the existing (old) man pages for various
	functions from libschily.

-	libfind/idcache.c now saves uname/gname as long as possible and uses
	strlcpy() instead of strncpy().

-	star now again stores up tp 16 bytes for uname in the old star
	archive format - not null terminated in case all bytes are used.

-	star -diff now correctly deals with the non null-terminated uname/gname
	strings from the old star archive format.

-	smake/job.c wait() now uses WEXITSTATUS(status) instead of Exit>>8

-	Fixed a typo in a comment from cdda2wav

-	patch now uses STD*_FILENO macros instead od 0, 1, 2.

-	patch added a security fix say(buf) -> say("%s", buf) as buf is
	text that was read from stdin before.

-	patch no longer uses atol() to parse line numbers in patches as atol()
	does not include a range overflow indication. A new function atolnum()
	was written to replace atol().

-	patch no longer tries to apply a patch to a place where no match
	was found at all. This usually happens with patches without context
	that need fuzzy matching. Previous patch versions tried fuzzy matching
	and under some conditions returned a "match" even though the loop with
	the match code was never entered.

-	patch no longer exit()s with -1 by default. This was a bug introduced
	when we where trying to avoid to cause wait() to report "exit code 0"
	just because wait() (in contrary to waitid()) limits the  exit code to
	8 bits and only the lower 8 bits have been 0.

-	The patch usage output for the POSIX variant now mentions the -u
	option.

-	The patch man page now mentions all names: "patch", "spatch", "opatch"
	and "sccspatch" and explains whether they behave like POSIX or like
	an enhanced original patch program from Larry Wall.

-	diff now returns correct line numbers for diff -U0 and inserted lines.
	This fixes a Solaris diff bug that is a result of a bug in the
	POSIX standard. Note that this bug affected patch(1) but not SCCS delta.

-	The SCCS test suite now tries to implement a workaround for the fact
	that "test -w file" does not work as expected for root. This is needed
	as Haiku currently does not allow to run any command for a non-root
	user.

-	The SCCS test suite now is clever enough to call gzip -d if uncompress
	is not installed on the test platform. This is needed on Haiku that
	by default does not include uncompress(1).

-	The SCCS manpages now mention that the existence of a file "dump.core" may
	tell the programs to cump core if certain signals have been delivered.
	These programs usually don't dump core and thus make debugging harder.


SCCS is now nearly fully functional on Haiku. The following problem stays:

-	Some time stamp problems exist for times around 1960 in SCCS history files.
	This seems to be a bug in localtime() on Haiku that causes an off by
	1 second error in the time_t result.
