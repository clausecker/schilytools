New features with AN-2016-08-19:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4


-	All: The makefilesystem added a new target "cstyle" to automatically
	check all sources for a specific project for correct indentation.

-	libschily: Some files fixed some Cstyle deviations.

-	calc: typo correction in the help text - wow this was a typo from 1984!

-	sdd: Cstyle corrections

-	cdrecord: The README file fixed a typo and the deprecated mail addresses.

-	mkisofs: isoinfo Cstyle fixes

-	bsh: Some files fixed some Cstyle deviations.

-	libshedit: Some files fixed some Cstyle deviations.

-	libshedit: the history editor now supports ^C as a special input and
	^V as "literal next" character.

-	bsh: new code to deal with the new libshedit feature.

-	Bourne Shell: ^C now results in a longjmp before the next prompt
	if typed while in the middle of a command line. This permits to
	abort command lines where the user does not know how to get out of
	the parser.

-	Bourne Shell: While expanding the PS4 prompt, "set -x" is deactivated
	to avoid an endless recursion.

-	Bourne Shell: Fixed a bug in the locale handling that was caused by
	forgetting to extend the fake environment to the same size as the list
	of environment variables of interest.

-	Bourne Shell: Clear variable "thisjob" after free()ing it to avoid using
	if past the free() call.
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for his advice on the address sanitizer to find
	the cause for this problem.

-	Bourne Shell: Now allocating a new Job slot when running a 
	vfork() -> script -> fork() chain as we wait() for the vfork() process
	and thus free() "thisjob" before calling fork().

-	SCCS: The testsuite did use "tail +2" but some "tail" implementations
	do not support "tail +2" while UNIX tail does not support the POSIX
	command line "tail -n +2". We now test what works and use a command
	line that fits the actual implementaion.

-	SCCS: The testsuite did use "touch 0101000090 $g", but some "touch"
	implementations (such as gtouch on Linux) do not support that. We now
	use "touch -t 199001010000 $g" if needed.


-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.


-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Try to make

		lastline=
		while read line
		do
			lastline=$line
		done < /etc/passwd
		echo "lastline=$lastline"

		print the last line of /etc/passwd without the exec "trick"
		that is documented in the man page.
	
	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
