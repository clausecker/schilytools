New features with AN-2017-05-16:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	autoconf/config.guess now groks Cygwin with amd64 on NT-10.

	Thanks to Thomas Plank for reporting.

-	autoconf got a new test for closefrom(). This helps to close all files
	from a certain fd on Solaris and recent BSDs.

-	RULES/rules.top: we now clear the macro COMPILE.cc= from SunPro make
	as well, in order to get our definition from the Schily Makefilesystem.
	Before, when using SunPro Make, C++ code was compiled without enabling
	the optimizer, as the SunPro Make default rule definition was used.

-	RULES/: Since SunPro Make from Schilytools now supports multiple
	includes with a single include directive, we added a new configuration
	for a SunPro Make that itself identifies now as "sunpro" via MAKE_NAME.

-	SunPro Make: removed an "auto" keyword in lin/bsd/src/bsd.cc
	as g++ 6.3 uses a new incompatible definition for "auto". The new
	incompatible definitin for "auto" was introduced by the new C++
	standard.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting.

-	SunPro Make: Our version now identifies itself by setting the macro:

		MAKE_NAME=sunpro

	This helps to identify that a SunPro Make version supports to include
	more than a single file with a single include directive.

-	SunPro Make: Fixed a bug in the "include" parser that caused dmake
	with (note the 2 spaces):

		"include  \n"

	to try to include a file with a name that equals the first word
	on the next line, regardless to whether the next line starts with
	a '#'. Dmake now silently ignores include directives with no filename
	argument which is aligned with the behavior from "smake" and "gmake".

-	SunPro Make: The sequence:

		FOO=
		include $(FOO)

	no longer complains about trying to include an empty file name
	but just ignores empty include lists. This makes SunPro Make
	better aligned as it now behaves like "smake" and "gmake".

-	SunPro Make: the include directive is now able to include
	more than a single file. This makes SunPro Make now compatible to
	"smake" and "gmake" and thus massively enhances the usability.

-	SunPro Make: HOST_MACH and TARGET_MACH now call "uname -m"
	if not on Solaris

-	SunPro Make: The option -R (do not run in parallel) has been
	enabled.

-	SunPro Make: A manpage for "dmake" has been created.

-	SunPro Make: The make.1s manpage now mentions the dmake.1
	manpage

-	SunPro Make: The make.1s manpage now better explains the
	Special-Purpose Macros HOST_ARCH, HOST_MACH, TARGET_ARCH,
	TARGET_MACH

-	SunPro Make: Cygwin does neither have ulimit.h nor ulimit()

	Thanks for Thomas Plank for reporting

-	SunPro Make: On Solaris 10, sem_post() is not in libc.
	On solaris, sem_post() is not in libpthread but in librt,
	so we need to fix the Makefile. Because of Linux, we need
	to link against $(LIB_RT) _and_ $(LIB_PTHREAD).

	Thanks to Dennis Clarke for reporting.

-	SunPro Make: The source has been converted to use an external
	#define TEXT_DOMAIN for the textdomain() call. This is to
	make it compatible to the OpenSolaris-ON makefile system.

-	SunPro Make: No longer set NLSPATH with a string that ends
	in ".cat" as we no longer use catgets().

-	SunPro Make: Allow to interpret the "USE_SVID" and
	"USE_SVR4_MAKE" environment on Linux the same way as on Solaris.

-	SunPro Make: Added a warning to main.cc that mentions that
	the automatic selection of the POSIX behavior is only possible
	in case that /usr/bin/make and /usr/xpg4/bin/make must be hardlinked.
	For this reason, /usr/bin/make and /usr/xpg4/bin/make definitely
	must be installed hard linked or as two separate copies on
	OpenSolaris.

-	SunPro Make: changed the #ifdefs to select between atexit()
	and on_exit() to be based on HAVE_ATEXIT.

-	SunPro Make: changed #ifdefs to make "exit_status" always
	available. This makes the code more readable and is not
	a great problem as most systems support atexit() anyway.

-	SunPro Make: avoid a close(i) loop if closefrom() is available.

-	SunPro Make: Avoid to address parts of the target strings
	before the start of the target string when trying to find
	a pattern match.

-	SunPro Make state:

	-	It compiles on Solaris, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, HP-UX,
		Cygwin (if g++ is not broken), Mac OS X.

	-	We need feedback for AIX, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD,
		HAIKU, IRIX, SCO

-	Bourne Shell: kill -l now no longer lists "bad sig" for nameless
	signals, but rather the signal number.

-	Bourne Shell: conformance testsuite: some missing "\" chars have been
	added before $(( in order to make sure that arithmetic expressions
	are evaluated by the shell under test. 

	Thanks to Robert Elz for reporting.


-	strar: Not yet ready, the current status is:

	This command is usable for basic work already The following features
	are currently missing:

	-	A method to descend directory trees, e.g. libfind

	-	A noclobber flag

	-	A method to avoid to replace files that are more recent on
		disk than in the archive.

	-	Set the file permissions

	-	Set the original file time stamps

	-	Set the original file owners.

	These features will be implemented in a future version.




-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.


-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Try to make

		lastline=
		while read line
		do
			lastline=$line
		done < /etc/passwd
		echo "lastline=$lastline"

		print the last line of /etc/passwd without the exec "trick"
		that is documented in the man page.
	
	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
