New features with AN-2013-03-27:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	cdrtools bumped tp 3.01a13

-	Fixed a typo in include/schily/stat.h that caused setting nanoseonds
	in timestamps to be impossible for NetBSD and OpenBSD.
	Thanks to a hint from Thomas Klausner <wiz@NetBSD.org>

-	-new-dir-mode in mkisofs now just superseeds the effect of -dir-mode
	on directories that have been "invented" by mkisofs.
	This is a more intuitive behavior.

-	The job processing code has been moved from smake/make.c -> smake/job.c
	This is another preparation to allow to deal with future versions
	os smake that will unclude support for parallel job execution.

-	Fixed a typo in the sccs.1 man page
