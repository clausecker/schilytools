New features with AN-2013-10-10:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	Many sources have been modified to deal __CYGWIN32__ like __CYGWIN__
	This is neded as newer Cygwin versions that run in 64 Bit mode
	do no longer define __CYGWIN32__ but __CYGWIN__

-	Fixed the scripts "cpfiles", "lnfiles" and "rmfiles" from the
	bootstrap section of "smake".

-	Added rules for non-automake enabled make programs (like gmake)
	for: ppc64-linux-cc.rul and ppc64-linux-gcc.rul

-	Added new OS version ID rules for various WIN-DOS versions:

	os-interix-nt-6.0.id
	os-interix-nt-6.1.id
	os-cygwin_nt-6.2-wow64.id
	os-cygwin_nt-6.2.id
	os-cygwin_nt-6.3-wow64.id
	os-cygwin_nt-6.3.id


-	Various Cstyle changes in the include/schily directory.

-	New include file: include/schily/shedit.h

-	Added defltsect() to the list of exported functions for the 
	shared library version of libdeflt.

-	Fixed a filedesrciptor leak in libfind that hits when using
	-empty on empty directories.

-	Cdrecord: Typo correction in a comment

-	Cdda2wav: Typo correction in a comment

-	Readcd: Typo correction in a comment

-	Added automatic support for ARMv5 and ARMv6. This makes compilation
	on the RaspberryPI also possible with the non-automake aware gmake.

-	Allow "static" compilation (a compilation that does not use the
	dynamic defines from the Schily Makefilesystem) on Linux ARMv6 (which
	is used by RaspberryPI).

-	"defltsect" was added as exported global function to libdeflt.

-	libfind now calls closedir() with -empty even on empty directories.

-	New autoconf test on whether <time.h> includes struct timespec

-	New autoconf tests check whether some functions (such as clock_gettime())
	are in libc or need a separate library

-	New: struct timespec in schily/time.h is granted to exist on all
	platforms

-	New functions getnstimeofday() and setnstimeofday() have been
	added to libschily.

-	Star now supports to extract time stamps with nanosecond granularity
	on platforms that support utimensat().

-	Star now also supports to extract time stamps for symlinks using
	utimensat(AT_FDCWD, name, tp, AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW).

	Note that star could (on some platforms) also permit to set the 
	file permission for symlinks using fchmodat() but this is already
	done using umask() since a long time and the only platform that
	is known to support different permissions on symlinks seems to be
	HP-UX.
	On a recent Solaris, you will not be able to set the file
	permissions for symlinks.

-	Star was converted to be completely timespec based. This offers 
	nanosecond granularity for all times on platforms that support
	a nanosecond clock.

-	Star now may be told to modify the path name (in case of -s/o/n/ or
	interactive change -w) before the time stamp is compared to
	existing files in the filesystem. This is done by using the new option
	-uncond-rename

-	Star no longer creates non-conforming archives when calling:

		star -c H=ustar dirname-with_101-chars/ > archive

	instead of:

		star -c H=ustar dirname-with_101-chars > archive

	Star now rejects to create archives with an empty t_name field.

-	"tartest" now warns about non-standard compliance if the
	t_name field is empty but the rest of the tar header contains
	data.

-	New include file include/schily/shedit.h

-	Ved now starts to warn about long .vedtmp.* files if the size
	is > 16384. Before it warned if the size is > 8192.

-	Fixed the SYNOPSIS line for the man page sccslog.1

-	"sccs help ut4" now reminds of a probably missing SCCS
	directory.

-	Many Cstyle changes in bsh. Note that the related files are also
	used by the Bourne Shell and we want it to match the Cstyle of
	OpenSolaris.

-	bsh/abbrev.c now avoids js_snprintf() to allow the Bourne Shell
	to be created with lazy library loading, so "bosh" will not load
	libschily if it is only interpreting shell scripts but not running
	in interactive mode.

-	libshedit was restructured to support dynamic linking on Mac OS X
	by avoiding to link against variables (unsupported by the dump
	Apple linker).

-	libshedit was restructured to permit lazy library loading, so 
	"bosh" will not load lishedit nor libxtermcap when not in interactive
	mode.

-	All exported funtion names from libshedit now start with 'shedit_'-

-	Cstyle changes in libshedit to permit integration into OpenSolaris

-	_Many_ Cstyle Changes to the Bourne Shell. It was not following
	the style rules for OpenSolaris even though it has been taken
	from OpenSolaris ;-)

-	The Bourne Shell now works when calling: set -o aliasowner=joerg
	or "bosh -o aliasowner=joerg" in order to e.g. allow to use the 
	persistent aliases for user joerg when running bosh as root.

-	The Bourne Shell now correctly lists the alias ownwer when
	calling "set +o"

-	The Bourne Shell now also recognises special argv[0] when
	passes: "jbosh", "-jbosh", "pfbosh", "-pfbosh", "rbosh", "-rbosh"

-	The Burne Shell now allows to switch from using system include files 
	to portable schily include files via:

		-DSCHILY_INCLUDES

-	An now unneeded data structture "struct blk" was removed from the
	Bourne Shell.
	This could have been done when we switched from sbrk() to malloc()
	already.

-	Document in the man page pf the Bourne Shell that the options
	-c/-i/-p/-r/-s may only be set at start from command line but
	not later in interactive mode.
