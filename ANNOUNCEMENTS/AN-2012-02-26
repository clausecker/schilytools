New features with AN-2012-02-26:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	The files cpfiles, lnfiles, rmfiles and MAKE-sh have been 
	enhanced by schily/inttypes.h and schily/stdint.h

-	star/restore.c now gives different error messages for two similar
	problems caused from different locations in the source.

-	The file Schily.Copyright has been updated to reflect recent 
	Copyright dates.

-	file_raise(NULL, FALSE) now also affects files that have been
	opened before the file_raise() call.
