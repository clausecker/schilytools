New features with AN-2014-06-06:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thouroughly.
		Please report problems!


-	smake was bumped to version 1.2.4 to make the new fixed version
	easier to recognise.

-	The smake man page now correctly points to SunPro make from SunOS-3.2
	as the first pattern matching rule implementation instead of mentioning
	SunOS-3.x

-	The Bourne Shell now implements true/false as builtin commands

-	The "old Bourne Shell" (osh) by default does not compile in
	true/false as builtin commands

-	The "repeat" builtin from the Bourne Shell now correctly cleans up
	allocated space when a repeated command is aborted via SIGINT.

-	Avoid a possible coredump when the Bourne Shell removes the current
	list of temporary files.

-	The Bourne Shell man page now correctly mentions that the "argument"
	parameter to the "trap" builtin command is optional.

-	The Bourne Shell now tries to call vfork() instead of fork() whenever
	it is reasy to implement. This increases the Bourne Shell performence
	by aprox. 15%. The Bourne Shell now is as fast as ksh93 when 
	interpreting scripts like "configure".

-	The "old Bourne Shell" (osh) by default does not compile in
	support for vfork()

-	cdrtools have been bumped to version 3.01a24

-	Star was bumped to version 1.5.3

-	Added supportlinks for amd64-freebsd-clang*. This allows to use non-
	automake aware make implementations like gmake.

-	libschily/faccessat.c with a faccessat() was added. This has been forgotten
	when the *at() functions have been implemented.

-	libschily/eaccess.c no longer calls access() in case the the OS does not
	implement eaccess() but rather first checks whether uid == euid and gid == egid.

-	Fixed a typo in autoconf/xconfig.h.in that caused the Win-DOS function
	LoadLibrary() not to be regognised correctly.

-	libschily/eaccess.c compiles again in HP-UX using the HP C-compiler

-	libschily/dlfcn.c new file to emulate dlopen() and friends on Win-DOS
	and HP-UX

-	libschily/lchmod.c was added

-	libschily/fchmodat.c no longer contains lchmod()

-	The linker mapfile libschily/libschily-mapvers now correctly
	makes the entry faccessat() depend on HAVE_FACCESSAT
