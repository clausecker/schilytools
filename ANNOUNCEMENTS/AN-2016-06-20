New features with AN-2016-06-20:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	All: introduced a new "make" target "tests" that starts the conformance
	test suite for those prorgrams that already implement it. The following
	projects already have an automated unit test:

	-	SCCS	This is the oldest testsuite that started in 2010.

			The test suite first removes all sccs binaries in the
			sccs source tree and then compiles and installs a new
			set of binaries for the install directory /tmp/SCCSTEST.
			Then the binaries in the source tree are removed again
			and rebuild.

	-	patch	These tests have been written in May 2015.

			It is recommended to have the schilytools installed
			before running this test as it likes to see
			/opt/schily/ccs/bin/diff

			This test suite creates random files and makes
			patch tests. It needs 5 minutes to 2 hours depending
			on the speed of the machine.

	-	sh	A new test suite that started in January 2016

		The whole test suite for all three programs takes aprox. 10
		minutes on a typical PC.

-	All: conf/oarch.sh added a rule for AIX

-	cstyle: long lines now get a new error message that includes the
	actual line length.

-	cstyle: added a new check for files that do not end in a newline.

-	p: The p programm could abort on Linux when run from a "sudo" session
	because there was no access to open /dev/tty. P now only prints a
	warning and falls back to "stderr".

-	patch: Conformance tests now work on Linux
	To those who like to run the "patch" test suite, please note that
	"gpatch" is used as a reference for some of the tests where it works 
	correctly. Since gpatch is buggy, there may be error messages from
	gpatch that you may ignore. If the test passes as a whole, everything
	is OK.

-	SCCS: Mention in the sccs-admin man page and online-help that SCCSv6
	supports anything but nul characters in text files.

-	SCCS: diff: fixed a bug introduced in August 2015 while introducing
	a workaround for a HP-UX strftime() bug. The bug caused diff
	with "-c" to print a rotten time string. The workaround now only hits
	when using "diff -u" and thus includes the "%z" format from HP-UX 
	that needs to be fixed.

-	SCCS: sccs/lib/comobj/src/dodelt.c Fixed a bug with time stamp handling
	that has been introduced Oct 14 2015 while trying to add better support 
	for a GMT variant of SCCS. The bug could cause messages like:

		"Time stamp later than current clock time"

-	SCCS: sccs/lib/comobj/src/putmeta.c was fixed to avoid emitting empty
	"^AG r" entries in SCCSv4 format. The entry is a SCCSv6 meta data entry.
	The bug has been introduced Feb 25 2015 while making the code better
	structured.

-	SCCS: sccs/cmd/src/get.c was fixed for the GMT variant of SCCS.

-	SCCS: When the special test binaries for /tmp/SCCSTEST have been built,
	a new set of normal binaries is built.

-	SCCS Added a test for the correctness of the history format created
	by sccs admin.

-	Test Framework: The tests now may be configured to expect any non-null
	text on stdout or stderr.

-	Bourne Shell: Fix a bug from the very beginning, that caused the 
	Bourne Shell to stop executing any command after entering the following
	command:

		for i in 1 2 3 ; do echo $i; break 0; done

	in an interactive shell.

-	Bourne Shell: continue/break now return a zero exit status if the
	argument "0" is passed. This is required by POSIX.

-	Bourne Shell: "getopts" now sets $OPTARG to the failing option character
	(in C "optopt") in case that getopt() returned '?' or ':'. This is
	a change introduced by POSIX.

-	Bourne Shell: "getopts" now sets $name to '?' if getopt() returned -1.
	This is a change introduced by POSIX.

-	Bourne Shell: "test" now honors the changed semantics from POSIX.
	With an argument count between 0..4, the actions are selected from
	the number of args only.

-	Bourne Shell: the "find" builtin now may me disabled with the command
	line "smake COPTX=-DNO_SYSFIND"

-	Bourne Shell: the "printf" builtin now may me disabled with the command
	line "smake COPTX=-DNO_SYSPRINTF"

-	Bourne Shell: The hash code now indludes a bit to identify a special
	builtin. This is needed to switch on special handling for special
	builtins.

-	Bourne Shell: The shell now exits again with I/O redirect errors for
	special builtins.

-	Bourne Shell: The shell now exits with option errors for special
	builtins. This is required by POSIX.

-	Bourne Shell: "command" now only prevents the shell to exit for the
	command that is the first argument. This feature is no longer
	propagated to commands executed from "eval" to follow POSIX.

-	Bourne Shell: The "getopts" tests have been rewritten to permit them to
	be used with other shells.

-	Bourne Shell: The "getopts" tests now include a test that checks whether
	the shell has been linked against an unfixed version of getopt() from
	the Solaris libc that may cause an abort via SIGSEGV with some
	"getopts" arguments.

-	Bourne Shell: Some "here" tests have been given a larger timeout in order
	to permit them to be run on a slow machine.

-	Bourne Shell: New tests to verify the correct behavior with shell errors
	have been added.

-	Bourne Shell: The file macro.c was rewritten to use more functions
	in order to limit the line width to 80 chars.

-	Bourne Shell: The code has been modified to match "Cstyle" conventions.
	This has been done before with modified source code but not with
	untouched code that was left in the state from AT&T. Now that "sh"
	contains less that 25% original AT&T code, it makes no sence to keep
	the so far untouched code in an indentation style that is not compatible
	with OpenSolaris.


-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Do not list functions when calling "set" with no arguments.
	  Note that this POSIX requirement is seen as a POSIX bug as there
	  is no POSIX command to list function definitions.
	  NOTE that this will not be implemented before POSIX bug
	  http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=1025 was fixed.

	- A POSIX whitepaper at: http://www.unix.org/whitepapers/shdiffs.html
	  claims that:
			IFS=o; violet

	  should not execute "vi". The normative text in the POSIX standard
	  describes the historic Bourne Shell behavior, but the rationale
	  describes the deviating behavior from "ksh".


	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be SUSv8)

	We are getting very close to full POSIX support.


-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Try to make

		lastline=
		while read line
		do
			lastline=$line
		done < /etc/passwd
		echo "lastline=$lastline"

		print the last line of /etc/passwd without the exec "trick"
		that is documented in the man page.
	
	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not excute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
