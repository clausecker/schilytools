New features with AN-2014-01-27:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	psmake (the bootstrap smake compile environment) again compiles
	on Solaris (and probably others). This has been achieved by using

		-DNO_FPRFORMAT -DNO_NL_ARGS

	to deactivate recent enhancements in printf()

-	include/schily/varargs.h now includes a new type va_lists_t
	that is a structure that covers va_list.

-	include/schily/getargs.h now has comment for the arguments and
	return code of the getargs() callback functions.

-	The schily makefilesystem now includes a new symlink
	ppc64le-linux-cc.rul for non-automake aware make implementations
	such as gmake.

-	New autoconf tests for strspn() strcspn() wcsspn() wcscspn()

-	libschily now implements strspn() strcspn() wcsspn() wcscspn()

-	libschily/format.c (the low level printf() implementation) now
	implements support for %n$ argument repositioning for the
	case that "n" is 1..30, or if larger points to an int type arg.

-	libschily/fprformat.c fixed a bug that would prevent to use
	stdio macros with newer OpenSolaris versions, making printf()
	not as fast as expected.

-	libschily/getargs.c no longer dumps core when boolean flags are
	combined into a single string and one or more of these flags
	trigger a callback function.

-	libsiconf/sic_nls.c: sic_open() no longer tries to open all
	characterset names as files in the current directory but only
	if the name contains a slash. Thanks to a report from
	Vladimir Marek <Vladimir.Marek@oracle.com>

-	star no longer archives all files as sparse file when using 

		star -c -sparse -force-hole

	but only those files that include at least one aligned block
	of 512 zeroed bytes.

-	cdrtools bumped to Version 3.01a22

-	Better error messages in mkisofs/apple.c

-	mkisofs now inplements a new option -legacy that allows to get back the
	options -H/-L/-P that have been deprecated in 2002 and disabled in 2006
	in the definition from the 1990s.
	If you like to use this feature, write a wrapper shell script that calls:

		mkisofs -legacy "$@"

	Note that -H/-L/-P have been disabled in 2006 and mkisofs will soon
	introduce -H/-L/-P with a POSIX compatible definition as announced since
	2002. So take care to convert your scripts to call:

		-map			for the old definition of -H 
					(-H valid between 2000 and 2002)
		-allow-leading-dots	for the old definition of -L
					(-L valid between 1995 and 2002)
		-publisher		for the old definition of -P
					(-P valid between 1993 and 2002)

-	The mkisofs man page now correctly documents the new behavior from libsiconv

-	The mkisofs man page now mentions sfind(1) as a man page to read 
	about the interface if the -find option.
