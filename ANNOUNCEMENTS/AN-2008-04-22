New features with AN-2008-04-22:

-	The source for the program "copy" has been added.
	Copy is similar to cp, but it copies any type of file
	and it is able to copy sparse files correctcly.
	On Solaris 10 and Solaris 11, copy uses SEEK_DATA/SEEK_HOLE
	for 100% correct and fast sparse file copying.

-	The source for the program "mountcd" has been added.
	mountcd is a support program written for SchilliX

-	The source for the program "udiff" has been added.
	udiff is a simple diff(1) implementation that by default outputs the
	diff information in human readable form.

-	A bug in libfind was fixed that causes

	find . -size -20k -ls

	to check for files smaller than 20480 Blocks instead of
	looking for files smaller than 2084 characters.

-	libfind version bumped to 1.4

-	star/gnutar.c fixed (added missing &) to avoid a core dump 
	with "gnutar -mode ...."

-	star bumped to star-1.5-final

-	The shell command line editor (used by "bsh" and "sh") now
	skips time stamp lines created from bash when reading the 
	~/.history file. This helps to keep the history clean.

-	Some code in mkisofs::main() has been reordered to allow mkisofs to 
	recognize that the installation at /opt/schily/lib/siconv is missing
	even if the --ethershare option has ben used. Before, mkisofs did dump
	core in this case, now it mentions to install libsiconv.

-	New smake special macros MAKE_SHELL_FLAG and MAKE_SHELL_IFLAG
	allow to control the shell flags that are used to call commands from
	smake. The default is MAKE_SHELL_IFLAG=-c for "smake -i" and
	MAKE_SHELL_FLAG=-ce for all other calls. If the special target .POSIX:
	is present in a makefile or if smake is called with -posix, 
	the default is MAKE_SHELL_FLAG=-c

-	Allow copy/copy.c to compile with a K&R compiler

-	Include again signal.h in ved/terminal.c to make ved again act on
	terminal resize events (SIGWINCH).
