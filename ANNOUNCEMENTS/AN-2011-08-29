New features with AN-2011-08-29:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	README.compile now includes instructions on how to compile
	using a cross compiler.

-	conf/mkdep-msc.sh now includes a workaround for a bug in the
	Microsoft compiler. The MS compiler outputs filenames like:
	'.\\scg/xxx.h' but '.\\name' is not accepted as filename.

-	include/schily/termios.h has been enhanced to better deal with
	nonstandard platforms like Win-DOS.

-	New autoconf test for conio.h

-	New autoconf test for int*_t and uint*_t

-	include/schily/termios.h now defines USE_GETCH in case there 
	is no standard TERMIOS

-	include/schily/limits.h now includes sys/param.h where available in
	order to make sure PIPE_BUF was defined before we define out fallback.

-	The performance of the mkgmtime() function in libschily has been enhanced
	This affects e.g. SCCS

-	libschily::fgetline() now calls fgets() in case that getc() is not
	a macro. This speeds up performance.

-	libschily::fgetstr() now calls fgets() in case that getc() is not
	a macro. This speeds up performance.

-	udiff(1) is now aprox. 20x faster than before. Seeks are avoided,
	file I/O is buffered with larger blocks, common parts at the
	beginning of files are skipped.

-	udiff(1) now detects differences if one file ends without a
	newline and the other does not.

-	calltree(1) now compiles and works on Win-DOS using the Microsoft compiler.

-	ved(1) now compiles and works on Win-DOS using the Microsoft compiler.
	Input only works from WIN-DOS window but not from xterm or ssh.
	Is there somebody who can help?

-	bsh(1) now compiles on Win-DOS using the Microsoft compiler.
	It does not yet link due to fork().

-	cpp(1) We cannot use char *inp / char *outp on Win-DOS
	because there are inp() and outp().

-	p(1) now compiles and works on Win-DOS using the Microsoft compiler.
	Input only works from WIN-DOS window but not from xterm or ssh.
	Is there somebody who can help?

-	patch(1) now compiles and works on Win-DOS using the Microsoft compiler.

-	mkisofs/devdump now compiles and works on Win-DOS using the Microsoft compiler.
	Input only works from WIN-DOS window but not from xterm or ssh.
	Is there somebody who can help?

-	mkisofs/isodump now compiles and works on Win-DOS using the Microsoft compiler.
	Input only works from WIN-DOS window but not from xterm or ssh.
	Is there somebody who can help?

-	sformat(1) now compiles and works on Win-DOS using the Microsoft compiler.

-	the diff(1) source now again mentions Harold Stone as author of the
	"best match" resync algorithm. This comment has been removed by
	AT&T for SVr4

-	The SCCS getline() library function no longer copies the line.
	This results in a 20% performance improvement on SCCS.

-	SCCS getline()/putline() now use a more efficient way to compute the
	checksum.

-	SCCS satoi() has been rewritten to be fast even with a compiler that
	offers a bad optimizer.


-	SCCS sccscvt new program to convert between SCCS v4 and SCCS v6 history
	file format.

-	The sccs command now also supports "sccs cvt" for the command "sccscvt"

-	The SEE ALSO section of most SCCS man pages has been reworked

-	SCCS admin now computes a checksum for the file content when called
	as admin -ifile s.file.

-	SCCS admin now prints full path names in warnings when a file does not
	end in a newline or includes a line that starts qith ^A in V6 mode.

-	SCCS delta no longer reads the new file two times before adding the delta.

-	SCCS delta is now more correct when checking whether a file includes
	SCCS keywords to expand.

-	SCCS delta now computes a checksum for the new content of the file.

-	SCCS libcomobj/date_ab.c now uses a specialized and speed up version of
	gN() for date_ab().

-	SCCS libcomobj/getline.c now uses a completely new algorithm to compute
	the checksum with better performance.

-	libschily/mkgmtime.c is now faster then previous release.
	Make it also correct when tm_month < 0 or > 11.
