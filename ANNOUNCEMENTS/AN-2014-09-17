New features with AN-2014-09-17:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thouroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4


-	include/schily/unistd.h now extends some exceptions to work around
	problems with the MS C-compiler to MinGW32.

-	Fixed a bug in mkisofs: -eltorito-platform Mac no longer uses the
	constant EL_TORITO_ARCH_PPC but EL_TORITO_ARCH_MAC as expected.
	Thanks to Ady <ady-sf@hotmail.com> for reporting.

-	Fixed an option parsing bug in mkisofs that was a result from
	option names that are beginning substrings of others. Mkisofs did
	try to fix this in 2006, but it seems that one option was missed
	in 2006. Now -hide-hfs was fixed, thanks to: 

-	Flush stderr before a question in cdda2wav. This is a workaround
	for a Linux libc bug (stderr must be unbuffered acording to the
	standard).

-	The builtin type(1) from bsh now uses an exit code of 1 in case that
	a parameter is not related to an existing executable object.

-	sccs/man/sccsfile.4 better wording

-	sccs/man/sccsfile.4 man page now mentiones which sccs programs
	write or modify s.files.

-	sccs/man/changeset.4 enhanced content

-	sccs/man/* Now mention AUTHORS

-	sccs/man/*.1 The SYNOPSIS section of all man pages was converted
	to conform to man(5) style rules.

-	sccs/man/*.1 now mention the option -q that enables NSE specific
	extensions. The NSE extensions in SCCS are still partially present
	but have been undocumented until now.

-	sccs/man/*.1 now mention the option -z that enables CMF specific
	extensions for MR number handling. The CMF extensions in SCCS are
	still partially present but have been undocumented until now.

-	sccs/man/*.1 now correctly document options that do not allow a
	space between the option letter and the argument.

-	sccs/man/*.1 mentioning the new environment variable:
	SCCS_NO_HELP that switches off automated sccs help output for
	error messages that obviously contain a SCCS error code covered
	by "sccs help <code>".

-	sccs/man/sccs-admin.1 mentioning the new environment variable:
	SCCS_V6 that causes SCCSv6 history files to be created by default.

-	sccs/man/sccs-admin.1 now mentionns the 'z' flag that was
	introduced by Sun for the CMF extensions from NSE.

-	sccs/man/sccs-delta.1 better documentation for the -g option.

-	sccs/man/sccs-delta.1 now mentions a bug with SCCSv6 and delta -g 

-	sccs/man/sccs-delta.1 now documents the NSE specific options -f / -h

-	sccs/man/sccs-get.1 now documents the format of the p.file.

-	sccs/man/sccs-get.1 now documents the Sun specific option
	-w<%W%-string>

-	sccs/man/sccs-prs.1 now documents the CMF specific keyword extensions

-	sccs/sccs/hdr/defines.h was enhanced due to lib comobj changes

-	sethome.c (a new file for SCCSv6 changeset support) was moved from
	mpwlib to comobj as mpwlib is the former libPW (Programmers Workbench)
	from AT&T that is not related to SCCS but contains code of general
	interest. Lib comobj on the other side is the generic SCCS support
	library.

-	The code to create the initial path for a file for the SCCSv6 meta data
	was moved from admin.c to lib comobj/src/setinitpath.c.

-	A bug in SCCS mpwlib/src/urandom.c was fixed. The bug caused all	
	microsecond values from gettimeofday() to be replaced by a random value
	in case gettimeofday() did never deliver tv_usec == 0 before. As this
	was done using an uninitialized random generator, the values have
	always been taken from the same set and thus havebeen predictable.

-	mpwlib/src/urandom.c now always implements and exports the functions:
	tv2urand() and urand2tv() to allow to convert urandom values back
	to timevals (based on the epoche "2004 Jan 10 13:37:04 UTC") and 
	vice versa.

-	A bug in admin.c that caused admin(1) to corrupt SCCSv6 history files
	in case that the -t option was used has been fixed.

-	A bug in admin.c that caused admin(1) partially write a wrong SID
	specific checksum in SCCSv6 history files when an empty file was
	created has been fixed.

-	The SCCS admin program now by default creates SCCSv6 history files
	in case that the environment variable "SCCS_V6" is present.

-	The SCCS get program now implements a new option -F that enforces to
	retrieve a g-file even if there was a SCCSv6 SID specific checksum
	missmatch.

-	The SCCS get program now disables to check the SID specific SCCSv6
	checksum in case that the -i or -x option habe been used.

-	The SCCS prs program now correctly reads SCCSv6 history files
	even in case that the keyword :FD: was used.

-	The SCCS val program now correctly reads SCCSv6 history files
	even in case that the options -y / -m have been used.

-	The SCCS val program had a bug that was caused by a forgotten change
	from the test version to the final version and offered to check
	SCCSv6 SID specific checksums with -h, but internally expected an
	option -S. This is now coherent and -h works.

-	All SCCS programs now by default try to analyze the error messages
	and when an error message ends in a parenthesized SCCS error mesage,
	the SCCS help code is executed as library version. If this behavior
	is not desired, the user should put SCCS_NO_HELP into his environment.

-	The SCCS help command moved the relevant code into libcomobj and now
	uses the same library version of the code as all other SCCS programs
	use to write the new extended error messages.

-	The SCCS help output for "sccs_subcmds" and basic sub-commands (intro)
	now delivers the subcommands in alphabetic order.

-	The SCCS help output for "delta" now documents the
	NSE specific options -f / -h

-	The SCCS help output for "get" now mentions -F

-	The SCCS help output for "get" now mentions the Sun Option -w%W%-string

-	The SCCS help output for "val" now mentions -h

-	The SCCS help output for "prs "now mentions the CMF specific
	keyword extensions

-	The SCCS help output now mentions the option -V for all apropriate
	programs

-	The SCCS help output now mentions the option -q (NSE) for all apropriate
	programs

-	The SCCS help output now mentions the option -z that enables CMF specific
	extensions for MR number handling.

-	The command "sccs enter/create ..." now accepts the -V6 flag to
	enforce to create a SCCS v6 history file.

-	tests/bin/echo_nnl has been rewritten to allow sh -ce ". echo_nnl"
	to work (do not test $? but the command result directly).

-	sccs/tests/README was updated

-	sccs/tests/sccstests/common/real-thing now checks whether the
	SCCS implementation under test supports the SCCS V6 history format
	and sets TESTING_SCCS_V6=true on success.

-	sccs/tests/Makefile has been rewritten to allow to check SCCS in
	V4 and V6 mode.

-	sccs/tests/sccstests/binary/basic.sh now also supports SCCS V6

-	Mention in sccs/tests/cssctests/README that this is the original
	README from the imported unit tests from the CSSC project.

-	sccs/tests/cssctests/README_ORIGIN now mentions that the tests
	in cssctests are bases on CSSC version 1.3.1

Important note: The program delta(1) is currently buggy with respect to a
		SCCS v6 history file when "delta -g<sid-list> s.file" is
		called. This is because the SID specific checksum is computed
		from the current file content, but "delta -g..." tells
		get(1) to extract something different than what we checked in.

The following modifications have been applied to the test suite in the
directory sccs/tests/cssctests/ in order to support SCCS_v6 as well:

-	$TESTING_SCCS_V6		This variable has been added in order
					to deal with different behavior of
					SCCS in case that SCCSv6 history files
					are used.

-	Test c3 in admin/admin-hz.sh	This test intentionally destroys the
					SCCS checsum in line 1 of the history
					file. The original code also destroys
					the V6 header and results in "V3"
					instead of "V6". The new code reverts
					this accidental effect.

-	Text C2 in admin/comment.sh	This tests checks the date/time format
					in the delta table. As the SCCSv6
					history format always uses a 4-digit
					year format, the test needs to check
					a different format whether in v4 or v6
					mode.

-	binary/auto.sh			Several tests are related to auto-uu-
					encoding of files in case that there
					is content that is unsupported by
					SCCSv4. As SCCSv6 treats everything as
					test files as long as there is no NUL
					character present, these tests need
					to be different for SCCSv6 history
					files.

-	binary/seeking.sh		This script contains more corner
					cases for text vs. binary files that
					behave different vor SCCS v4 and v6.

-	get/excl_ig_2.sh		Warns on a SCCSv6 bug with delta -gsid
