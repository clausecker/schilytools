New features with AN-2015-06-99:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	include/schily/signal.h now includes siginfo.h to make sure it
	compiles even on very old Solaris versions where signal.h did not
	yet include siginfo.h.

-	include/schily/wait.h add a missing closing bracket for Haiku

-	include/schily/wait.h added CLD_* macros and the enum idtype_t in case
	they are missing. This allows to implement a waitid() emulation.

-	include/schily/wait.h now includes schily/signal.h in case that
	the local /usrinclude/sys/wait.h is non-POSIX and does not
	define siginfo_t. This is e.g. the case on FreeBSD.

-	The configure tests now include test that correctly identify Mac OS X as
	non-POSIX with respect to waitid(). This prevents potential users of
	waitid() from the unusable implementation on Mac OS X.

	The rule for accepting an existing waitid() is the following:

	-	si.si_pid is set to be equal to the awaited pid

	-	si.si_code == CLD_EXITED for a chilt terminated by exit(2)

	-	si.si_status contains at least 16 bits from the exit(2)
		code. This is still not POSIX but better than what we would
		get from a historical wait*() call.

-	The configure tests now check for the new FreeBSD wait6() and for
	idtype_t.

-	A new symlink for x86_64-cygwin32_nt-gcc.rul was added

-	The hdump man page now mentions that the program also implements the od(1)
	comand line interface.

-	Install an "od" man(1) page as an alias to the "hdump" man page.

-	A "new" program "scut" was added to schilytools

-	A "new" program "spaste" was added to schilytools

-	Bsh now again uses our own wait3() implementation on Solaris and thus
	is again able to report more than just the times for the command status.
	Compilation now can also be controlled manually using:
	COPTX=-DFORCE_OWN_WAIT3
	and
	COPTX=-DNO_OWN_WAIT3

-	Bourne Shell: New timestamp for the shell version.

-	Bourne Shell: The builtin "times" no longer rounds up the seconds.
	This has become nonsense since we added milliseconds in May 2012.

-	Bourne Shell: the builtin "true" now causes the shell to exit in case
	that set -e was used. The wrong behavior was introduced in May 2014
	when trus and false did become builtin commands.

-	Bourne Shell: is now using waitid() instead of waitpid().

-	Bourne Shell: now implements a waitid() emulation based on waitpid().
	This is needed on many non-POSIX platforms such as FreeBSD and Mac OS X.
	While newer FreeBSD include a working waitid() emulation, Mac OS X
	offers a waitid() that is completely unusable even though it claims
	to have a POSIX certification.

-	Bourne Shell: now implements a new function code2str() to convert
	the values from struct siginfo .si_code into a string.

-	Bourne Shell: added a new function wait_id() for backtick expansion
	that allows to get the whole 32 bits from the exit(2) parameter.

-	Bourne Shell: smake COPTX=-DNO_WAITID allows to enforce the waitid()
	emulation via waitpid() to enforce the old behavior where the
	exit code is limited to 8 bits.

-	Bourne Shell: a new structure "excode" and new excode variables
	"ex" and "retex" will be used for enhanced status reporting in
	the future. They currently only work correctly for non-builtin
	commands where the status can be retrieved from waitid().

-	Bourne Shell: A new function sitos() allows to convert negative
	integers correctly. This is mainly needed in order to be able to
	print the full signed int exitcode retrieved via waitid().

-	Bourne Shell: exit(1) now allows to use negative parameters. This
	reflects the fact that exit(2) has a signed integer as parameter.

-	Bourne Shell: New readonly status variables have been added. These
	variables are not the final state but a discussion base for a POSIX
	enhancement:

	$excode		The numerical value of siginfo_t.si_code.
			Note that there is not yet a special value that flags
			"exit values" that do not come from a child process
			but from the shell itself.

	$excodename	The name for $excode, created by stripping off the
			initial "CLD_" prefix. Currently the following names
			are possible:

			EXITED	Program exited nomally, $exstatus has 
				the exit(2) parameter.

			KILLED	Program was killed by a signal $exstatus has
				signal number.

			DUMPED	Program was killed by a signal and dumped core.
				$exstatus has signal number.

			TRAPPED	Traced child has stopped

			STOPPED	Program was stopped by a signal $exstatus has 
				signal number.

			CONTINUED Program was continued.

	$exstatus	The numerical value of siginfo_t.si_status.

	$extermsig	The value from siginfo_t.si_status converted into a
			signal name using the kill(1) rules (stipping off
			"SIG"). This conversion always takes place, not just
			when the program was terminated by a signal.

	$exsigno	The numerical value that caused the action. For now,
			this only affects waitid() and thus always contains
			SIGCHLD. Later versions of the shell will set this
			variable to the causing signal when a trap(1) command
			is executed.

	$exsigname	The signal name for $signo

	$expid		The pid of the process that was waited on.


-	Bourne Shell: If $exstatus is != 0 and $? is == 0, $? is assigned
	the special value 128. This helps to avoid that a script incorrectly
	believes that a program exited with a zero exit code just because
	exitcode & 0xFF == 0.



-	The SVr4 package meta data information for the CSW packets has been 
	made up to date:

	-	od is now delivered as link to hdump

	-	cstyle is included

	-	mdigest is included

	-	scut and spaste are included

	-	osh (the portable unfixed version of the OpenSolaris Bourne Shell)
		is included

	-	The new libschily man pages are included

	-	The man pages sccs-log(1), sccs-cvt(1) and sccschangeset(4)
		have been added

	-	Various new include files from include/schily have been added.

	-	various directories that are created by the package CSWcommon
		no longer include permission and owner information
