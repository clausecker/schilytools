New features with AN-2014-03-18:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	Typo fix in README.compile for the mail address.
	Thanks to Dennis Clarke for the catch!

-	Cdrtools have been bumped to version 3.01a23

-	Cdda2wav no longer includes the new paranoia mode "c2check" in the macro
	"proof". This has been done because of a report from Géraud Meyer <graud@gmx.com>
	that gives hints that the drive:
	Type: ROM, Vendor 'TSSTcorp' Model 'CDDVDW SH-222AB ' Revision 'SB00' MMC+CDDA
	does not handle hidden tracks when "c2check" is active.

-	mkisofs was slightly modified to reduce CPU time requirements.
	It now reads/writes in 64kBytes chunks instead of stdio buffer
	size which is typically 8 kB.

-	Fixed a typo in the mkisofs man page.
	Thanks to a hint from Donald R Laster Jr from Slackware.

-	Mkisofs now in addition prints "-iso-level 3 or more required"
	in case that a large file was skipped because of the current mkisofs settings.

	Thanks to a hint from Donald R Laster Jr from Slackware.

-	The timediff function in cdrecord now in addition prints the time
	diff in hours : minutes : seconds . thausands of a second.

	Thanks to a hint from Donald R Laster Jr from Slackware.

-	A problem in isoinfo has been fixed.
	This problem caused "isoinfo -R -find -ls" to print Jan 1 1970 timestamps
	in case that Rock Ridge was not present.

-	star -c list=filename 
	Now skips empty lines instead of stopping processing as if EOF was seen
	on "filename".

-	The Bourne Shell man page is now a bit closer to man(5) standards.

-	libschily/sleep.c and libschily/usleep.c have been modified to work
	with MinGW.
