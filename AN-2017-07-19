New features with AN-2017-07-19:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4


-	Schily Makefilesystem: Use the correct rules to create shared libraries
	on Cygwin. Before this release, shared libraries with Cygwin have not
	been tested and the old rules have been guessed.

-	RULES/rules.ins: fixed a typo in the symlink install rule

-	libschily: New pattern matcher functions

		patmbmatch() and patmblmatch()

	support multi byte strings with a wchar_t * pattern. The pattern is
	a wide char string for performance reasons.

-	TARGETS/55star_sym added a newline to make "make tinfo" work when
	/bin/sh is not a classical Bourne Shell. The code worked before because
	there was a bug in the classical Bourne Shell with sh -ce cmd.

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	DEFAULTS/Defaults.cygwin*: We no longer read the Microsoft configuration
	for cl.exe except when the makeprogram in use is "smake". This is needed
	as neither GNU make nor SunPro make support spaces in filenames and
	SunPro make aborts in case ".NO_WARN: :=" from DEFAULTS/vc7-cygwin-setup
	is seen.

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	configure: New tests for /usr/xpg4/bin/sh and /opt/schily/xpg4/bin/sh
	This helps to make SunPro Make in POSIX mode able to find a POSIX shell.

-	conf/oarch.sh: Fixed a typo that caused oarch to output e.g.

		i686-cygwin_nt-5.1-cc

	instead of

		i686-cygwin32_nt-cc

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	libfind: use $(LIB_INTL) to support Cygwin when creating a shared library

-	libdefault: Avoid a possible double fclose() call.

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	libschily: added a va_end() call after a va_copy()
	call in getargs.c

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	libedc: avoid a free()less malloc()  in the speedtest
	program.

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	libfile: better realloc() handling in case of a failure.

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	libscg::scsi-vms.c: abort scg__open() in case that "busno"
	has an illegal value. This avoids using uninitialized data
	as index in an array.

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	btcflash: added a missing (but not really needed) free()
	and fclose() call.

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	ved: added a missing "wp" argument for the rmap() macro
	for a currently unused compile variant. The new parameter
	was introduced in June 1999 but was not added to that
	piece of "dead code".

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	SCCS: libcassi: Avoided a malloc() call that created an unneeded
	and unfreed space.

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	SCCS: libcomobj: make date_ab() safe against date strings
	then end in '.' but do not include nanoseconds.

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	SCCS: libmpw: added a missing va_end() in cat().

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	bsh: added a missing free() call when macros are searched
	using patcompile()/patmatch().

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	bsh::cond.c: added a missing va_end() in the error case of
	skipuntil()

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	bsh::sys.c: avoid a double free() on the path when doing
	PATH search.

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	bsh::evops.c: realloc() returning NULL is now handled correctly

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	change: realloc() returning NULL is now handled correctly

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	star: added a missing '{' in commented out code.

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	SunPro Make: added a missing free() call in report_search_path()

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	cdda2wav: a patch from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt results in only trying
	to read the ISRC values for the tracks that should be extracted
	later.

-	cdrecord: updated the man page to list the names of the drives that support
	the defpregap= option.

-	cdrecord::subchan.c changed #ifdef sss -> #if 0 to calm down a
	static code analyzer.

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	mkisofs::apple_drive.c added a missing fclose(fp);

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	mkisofs::vms.c corrected a typo and now call ISO_ROUND_UP(use) instead
	of ROUND_UP(use)

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	Bourne Shell: added a hardlink /opt/schily/xpg4/bin/sh when installing
	the shell for the 100% POSIX variant of the Bourne Shell.

-	Bourne Shell: added a conformance test that checks whether

			bosh -ce 'read line < /dev/null; echo $?'

	exits before printing $?
	This bug caused the Bourne Shell not to fail in the Schily
	Makefile system with "smake tinfo" even though there was incorrect code.
	See above for more information.

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	Bourne Shell: added a new compliance test for above bug.

-	Bourne Shell: bosh -c 'set -u; echo $(( x = 3 ))' no longer
	aborts with "parameter not set" error.

	Thanks to Robert Elz for reporting

-	Bourne Shell: added a new compliance test for above bug.

-	Bourne Shell: rmfunctmp() now has a "base" parameter like rmtemp() to
	limit the removed files to files newer than a limit.

-	Bourne Shell: New variable "xiotemp" allows to limit the files
	removed by rmtemp() from inside done() to files newer than a limit.

-	Bourne Shell: added a forgotten initialization for hentry.next in hashserv.c

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	Bourne Shell: reworked the /tmp file management in the interpreter (xec.c)
	in order to avoid left over shell /tmp files. The previous Bourne Shells
	did not remove three /tmp files after running the Bourne Shell test suite.

-	SunPro Make: When in POSIX mode, use the new autoconf tests for
	/usr/xpg4/bin/sh and /opt/schily/xpg4/bin/sh and add a fallback to /bin/sh
	in case neither /usr/xpg4/bin/sh nor /opt/schily/xpg4/bin/sh are installed.

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	SunPro Make: add our own libgetopt to work around a libc bug on Haiku

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	SunPro Make: add INS_BASE "/share/lib/make" to the search PATH to give ./dmake
	a fallback chance to start with reading "make.rules".

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	SunPro Make: $(MAKE) is now set to a useful value even when it has not been
	defined at all. This makes SunPro Make usable together with the option -r.

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	SunPro Make: the man page now describes MAKE_NAME and the way MAKE is set up.

-	SunPro Make: The setup for SGS_SUPPORT= no longer uses unspecified
	behavior with the output buffer in snprintf() used as input by now using
	strcat() instead.

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting

-	smake: man page: The MAKE macro description was fixed.

-	p: use $(LIB_INTL) to support Cygwin

-	p: Avoid an endless loop in search mode when there still are a few characters
	in the buffer but reading the file does not return more data.



-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.


-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
