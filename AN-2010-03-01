New features with AN-2010-03-01:

-	Support for "pcc" on Solaris x86 was added as a first step.
	The C-Compiler "pcc" http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/ is based on the
	Portable C-Comppiler from AT&T from the late 1970s. It is
	under BSDl and thus offers compilation with a really free
	build environment.

	Note that due to a pcc bug, the autoconf results for
	Large File support are incorrect. Unless you edit the file
	incs/i386-sunos5-pcc/xconfig.h and manually correct the
	file to contain this:

#define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS 64    /* # of bits in off_t if settable          */ 

	You will not get working large file support.

	Support for more Operating system will follow after the issues
	in the compiler have been resolved.

-	conf/mkdep-aix.sh now calls "cc -M -qsyntaxonly" instead of
	"cc -M -E" as the IBM C-preprocessor does not like
	#pragma weak a = b
	although the compiler supports it.

-	Added support for DragonFly/x86_64

-	New autoconf test for nanosecond time stamps on AIX.

-	conf/mkdep-aix.sh was changed to avoid warnings for #pragma weak a = b
	as the IBM C-compiler calls a non "#pragma weak" cpp when called with -E

-	include/schily/stat.h now supports nonosecond timestamps in struct stat on AIX.

-	cdrtools bumped to 2.01.01a77

-	Fixed a bug in libfind/walk.c (calling strcatl() with last parameter 0
	instead of (char *)0)

-	sccs now is able to correctly code program paths based
	in INS_BASE by depending on PROTOTYPES instead of _STDC__

-	New autoconf tests for struct stat on AIX to support
	e.g. nanosecond tile timestamps.

-	include/schily/stat.h now supports struct stat.st_atime_n
	for AIX nanosecond support.

-	star/dumpdates.c works around a problem with LOCK_EX/LOCK_EX/LOCK_UN
	defined although the flock() call no longer exists.

-	The Bourne Shell now renamed "peekc" to "peekc_" because AIX
	has a hidden peekc() in libc.

-	The Bourne Shell tries to avoid to #define "index" as AIX
	has a #define index in string.h

-	Cdrecord now is able to use -isosize even in case that the image data
	is read from stdin. This makes it easier to use "mkisofs | cdrecord".


-	The CDRWIN cue sheet parser has been enhanced to give better error messages:

	-	There are now hints on what is missing in the CUE file

	-	The error message now also contains the column where the problem was detected

-	A description for the *.inf file fomat was added to the cdrecord man page

-	The *.inf file parser now supports a new tag "Track=" that
	is intended to carry the absolute track number from the original disk.

-	Cdrecord now supports to copy CDs with hidden track if there are *.inf files
	created by cdda2wav. In order to copy a CD with hidden Track with optimal
	quality, call:

	cdda2wav -vall -B -paranoia paraports=proof cddb=0
	cdrecord -v -sao -useinfo -text *.wav

-	cdwrite@lists.debian.org removed from man page
	please use the official mailing lists for cdrecord that exist since 10 years:
	http://developer.berlios.de/mail/?group_id=5

-	Hidden Track support is now complete:

-	Added support for writing Hidden Audio Tracks before Track #1
	in the Mtsushita CW-7501 device driver.

-	Added support for writing Hidden Audio Tracks before Track #1
	in the Sony CDU-924 / CDU-948 device driver.

-	Added support for writing Hidden Audio Tracks in RAW mode.
	Cdrecord-2.01.01a74 did put "track number 0" into the subchannel
	data for track 1 index 0. Cdrecord now correctly writes Track #1
	into the sub channel data.

-	Added support for Track #1 having a different number than 1 into
	the CUE file parser.

-	The CUE file parser now prints much better error messages in case that
	a keyword is seen out of the permitted order.

-	The CUE file parser now supports hidden tracks.

-	Added a workaround for a firmware bug in the drive:
	'HL-DT-ST' 'BD-RE  BH10LS30 ' '1.00'
	That causes the drive to return zero media size for BluRay media.

-	cdrecord now aborts if the cuefile= option was specified with a non-CD
	media in the drive.

-	CDRWIN CUE files now may refer to several data files where each data file
	contains less than the whole disk but more than a single track.

-	The CUE parser now correctly sets the sector size information for the
	lead-in area.

-	The CUE parser now by default only accepts CDRWIN CUE compliant files
	but may be switched into an enhanced mode by introducing a special comment
	"REM CDRTOOLS"

-	The CUE parser now supports a FILE command between INDEX 00 and INDEX 01.
	This is needed in order to write CUE sheets from Exact Audio Copy.
	Note that cdrecord needs to be switched into the enhanced CUE parser mode
	by either specifying "REM CDRTOOLS" or by specifying:
	REM COMMENT "ExactAudioCopy v0.99pb5"

	Also note that cdrecord currently does not support more than one FILE
	command per TRACK. For this reason, hidden audio tracks only work if
	the hidden audio data is in the same file that also contains data for
	track 1.

-	New commands "ARRANGER", "COMPOSER" and "MESSAGE" for adding CD-Text information
	in CUE files. Note that these commands are cdrecord specific extensions that
	re unknown by CDRWIN and thus need "REM CDRTOOLS" to be enabled.

-	The CUE file format is now documented in the cdrecord man page.

-	Fixed a small type bug in cdrecord/fifo.c (introduced a few
	versions before) that hits if the OS does not support the FIFO.

-	New (previously missing) CD-Text tags have been added to auinfo.c (*.inf file parser):

	Albumsongwriter=
	Albumcomposer=
	Albumarranger=
	Albummessage=
	Albumclosed_info=

	Note that these tags do not appear in the CDDB database.

-	Cdrecord no longer tries to close a session on a BD-RE media.
	This is not supported in the recent MMC Standard and most drives
	return a SCSI error when attempting to close such a session.

-	New cdda2wav arg "all" to -t option.

	cdda2wav -B	extracts all audio tacks into separate files
	cdda2wav -tall	extracts all audio tacks into a single files

-	cdda2wav now by default writes a file "xxx.cdtext" with raw binary
	CD-Text data in case cdda2wav was told to retrieve CD-Text.

-	A new option -no-textfile allows to disable the creation of the file "audio.cdtext"
	This version of cdda2wav creates a file "audio.cdtext" or similar (depending on
	the set up file name base) in case that there is CD-Text on the medium and that
	the drives supports to read the CD-Text data with MMC SCSI commands.

-	Fixed a bug in cdda2wav that caused cdda2wav to set up the file name base too late.
	This resultes in the files "audio.cdindex" and "audio.cddb" alwas to have this name
	while the *.inf files use the name base from the cdda2wav arguments. Now all
	files created by cdda2wav honor the file name base.

-	Cdda2wav by default fills empty track specific CD-Text data with the Disk global
	value (if present). A new option -no-textdefaults allows to disable this fallback
	and leaves the related fields empty if they are empty on the mester CD.

-	Fixed a problem with cdda2wav -interactive (used by GNOME GSTREAMER CD-DAE plugin)
	that could cause cdda2wav to dump core in case that there is a data
	session past the last audio track.

-	Cdda2wav now permits to use "max" for the endtrack number. This
	allows to specify e.g. -t2+max for a list of tracks from track #2
	to the last audio track on the disk.

-	New option -cuefile allows to tell cdda2wav to create a CDRWIN CUE
	file. This currently only works together with wither -tall, or with
	-t0+max or -t1+max.

	Note that due to a misconception in the CDRWIN CUE file definition,
	it is impossible to create 100% correct CD-audio copy by 100%
	following the CDRWIN CUE file definition and having separate audio
	files for each track at the same time. For this reason, it is currently
	impossible to create CDRWIN CUE files while using cdda2wav -B.

-	Cdda2wav now only writes a binary *.cdtext file in case that this
	file would contain more data than a header that tells that there
	is no further content.

-	Cdda2wav no longer removes the Index0 entry from a longer Index list
	if Index0 is -1.

-	Cdda2wav now automatically scans for hidden audio tracks. This is a
	complex task as there are drives that do not allow to read the
	hidden data before track 1.

-	New option -no-hidden-track allows to prevent cdda2wav from scanning
	for a hidden audio track.

-	Cdda2wav now writes the new tag "Track=" into the *.inf files that
	is intended to carry the absolute track number from the original disk.

-	A shortcut for paraopts=sectors-per-track-1,retries=200 was introduced.
	The name of the shortcut is "proof", so just use "paraopts=proof" for
	selecting the most stringent paranoia mode.

-	Cdda2wav now automatically selects paranoia mode in case that the
	paraopts= option was used.

-	Cdda2wav now again works in suid root mode on Solaris 11. It seems that
	the development versions from Solaris 11 did change the behavior with
	fine grained privileges in a way that was incompatible with the way
	cdda2wav did try to handle both suid root and fine grained privileges.

-	A forgotten debug message from implementing support for hidden tracks
	has been removed.

-	Fixed a small bug that made cdda2wav with hidden track support not fully
	compatible to earlier versions. In case that only one track is to be extracted,
	this is again always track #1 regsrdless whether the CD has a hidden track.

-	Fixed a bug with CDRWIN CUE file support. Cdda2wav used the tag "WAV" instead
	of "WAVE" for the data type specifier in the FILE tag.

-	cdwrite@lists.debian.org removed from man page
	please use the official mailing lists for cdrecord that exist since 10 years:
	http://developer.berlios.de/mail/?group_id=5

-	Hidden Track support is now complete:

-	Fixed a bug in the cdda2wav track loop control that caused cdda2wav
	not to write the *.inf file for the last track in case of an audio CD
	with a hidden track.

-	Introduced an alias "isrc" and "ISRC" for -vtrackid

-	Introduced an alias "mcn" and "MCN" for -vcatalog

-	cdda2wav now emits a "PREGAP" keyword in the CUE file for a CD without
	hidden track if it starts with a sector number > 0.

-	New cdda2wav option -vaudio-tracks

-	Make cdda2wav -q silent again (even with CDs with hidden track) to
	make it compatible again with scripts.

-	cdda2ogg and cdda2ogg.1 added to standard install
	The script cdda2ogg was enhanced to work seamlessly.

-	cdda2mp3 and cdda2mp3.1 added to standard install
	The script cdda2mp3 was enhanced to work seamlessly.

-	the scripts cdda2ogg and cdda2mp3 now allow to forward options to
	cdda2wav.

	In order to enable "paranoia mode", call:

	cdda2ogg -paranoia

	In order to enable the most proof "paranoia mode", call:

	cdda2ogg -paraopts=proof

-	The cdda2ogg man page was completely reworked

-	The SYSvr4 pkg definition now includes cdda2ogg and cdda2mp3

-	Added a workaround for a broken ASPI that hangs with
	odd transfer counts.


-	Fixed a bug with file descriptor handling in mkisofs/apple.c

-	The man page for mkisofs was enhanced in order to better mention
	that mkisofs always writes ISO-9660 and that other file systems are
	thus always added as a hybrid file system.
