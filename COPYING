GPL compatibility notes:

No non-GPL source is based on or derived from GPL code.

The terms and conditions of the GPL only cover a GPLd work but do not
extend to other works that have been published under a different license.

Linking a GPL'd work with another work does not create a "derived work"
but a "collective work". In case of a collective work, the GPL is very
obvious with only requiring the GPLd parts to be covered by the terms 
and conditions of the GPL. The GPL however requires the other parts to
be delivered with the GPLd parts in order to permit to rebuild the binary.


Note: In case of statical linking, the resulting "mkisofs binary" is a 
combination of several separate projects (works) under different licenses.
If you combine code from different licenses, you need to honor the legal
implications from the included GPL code and the other code.

If you just publish the complete original cdrtools source, you honor the GPL.
If you like to create a separate mkisofs package, be careful to verify that
everything that is needed to compile mkisofs is contained in this package.
